Amazon.com Inc., which is selling investment-grade debt, saw its shares slump. Trading volume was below the average of the past month. A gauge measuring the global yield curve inverted for the first time in at least two decades -- signaling a recession. \nPowell is expected to cement expectations the Fed will slow its pace of hikes next month -- while reminding Americans that its fight against inflation will run into 2023. Some policymakers stressed this week they will raise borrowing costs further, with one key official saying that he sees rates heading somewhat higher than he had forecast just a couple of months ago.\n“The Fed has hiked enough -- and quickly enough -- to make recession a base-case scenario in our book,” said Lauren Goodwin, economist and portfolio strategist at New York Life Investments. “Volatility and risk premia are likely to remain elevated as long as the Fed is fighting inflation in a growth slowdown.”\nGoodwin also noted that equity earnings don’t usually begin to drop until an economic recession starts. That means equity market fundamentals “may still deteriorate,” she added.\nCorporate America’s bloated margins are likely to start coming down in 2023 as certain expenses start to normalize, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s David Kostin. The firm’s strategists, along those at other banks including Morgan Stanley have been saying they see a slowdown in earnings growth next year.\nAlicia Levine at BNY Mellon Wealth Management says that even in a shallow recession, S&P 500 companies can still see earnings declines of 20%.\n“There is still risk here in the end,” Levine told Bloomberg Television. “This is the transition year. Next year is, ‘OK, now your rates are higher, what does it mean for the real economy?’ And that I think we really have not priced in.”\nRead: Barclays Delays Call for US Recession, Fed Cuts Amid Strong Data\nRead: BofA Says the US Yield Curve Will Return to Normal on Fed Pivot\nThe Fed’s actions, stubborn inflation, the war in Ukraine and the outlook for corporate earnings “make for a tough tale to tell for the stock market over the next 12 months,” said Kevin Philip, partner at Bel Air Investment Advisors.\nLast week, institutional clients and hedge funds poured money into stocks, while retail clients sold off for a fifth straight week -- with selling likely to continue through next month, according to Bank of America Corp. strategists led by Jill Carey Hall.\nRecent flow momentum along with lack of “capitulation-like outflows” signal that investors believe the market has already bottomed. But BofA strategists say they see further downside risk ahead of a first half of 2023 bottom.\nSeveral widely followed DeMark indicators, which try to anticipate momentum and long-term trend reversals, suggest the Cboe Volatility Index may be poised for a reversal.\nHistory shows that the appearance of a “countdown 13” pattern has led to turns in the past, with a cluster of such signals occurring at the more-recent lows. The so-called fear gauge last week fell to its lowest level since August as the S&P 500 advanced.\nMeantime, former greenback bulls including JPMorgan Asset Management and Morgan Stanley say the era of dollar strength is ending as cooling prices spur markets to trim bets on further Fed tightening. That may spell buying opportunities for the currencies of Europe, Japan and emerging markets.\nKey events this week:\nEIA crude oil inventory report, WednesdayChina PMI, WednesdayFed Chair Jerome Powell speech, WednesdayFed releases its Beige Book, WednesdayUS wholesale inventories, GDP, WednesdayS&P Global PMIs, ThursdayUS construction spending, consumer income, initial jobless claims, ISM Manufacturing, ThursdayBOJ’s Haruhiko Kuroda speaks, ThursdayUS unemployment, nonfarm payrolls, FridayECB’s Christine Lagarde speaks, Friday\nEIA crude oil inventory report, Wednesday\nChina PMI, Wednesday\nFed Chair Jerome Powell speech, Wednesday\nFed releases its Beige Book, Wednesday\nUS wholesale inventories, GDP, Wednesday\nS&P Global PMIs, Thursday\nUS construction spending, consumer income, initial jobless claims, ISM Manufacturing, Thursday\nBOJ’s Haruhiko Kuroda speaks, Thursday\nUS unemployment, nonfarm payrolls, Friday\nECB’s Christine Lagarde speaks, Friday\nMLIV Pulse surveyWill the ugliest year for US credit get even uglier?

    "content": "US stocks ended Friday little changed as investors assessed prospects for less-aggressive central bank tightening and weighed China’s latest move to stimulate its economy. \nThe S&P 500 wavered for most of Friday’s shortened trading session. But its weekly gain of 1.5% took the index to the highest level since early September. The Nasdaq 100 also eked out a gain for the week, despite dropping on Friday. Most Treasuries erased early losses.\n“It’s a slow day with US market holiday,” said Marija Veitmane, senior multi-asset strategist at State Street Global Markets. “We’re seeing a bit of profit taking and position adjustment post a strong risk rally last week.”\nSentiment was boosted this week after the Federal Reserve’s Nov. 1-2 meeting minutes showed most officials backing slowing the pace of interest-rate hikes. Since the Fed’s latest meeting, investors have parsed a bevy of economic data that somewhat eased inflation concerns, further strengthening the case for smaller rate hikes.\nAll eyes will be on the jobs report next week and on Fed Chair Jerome Powell and New York Fed President John Williams, who are among central bank officials scheduled to speak. Both officials will make clear that a tight labor market and elevated services inflation will keep the Fed hiking for longer, strategists with TD Securities wrote in a note.\n“As markets welcome the prospect of smaller hikes, we expect them to counter that by emphasizing the need to reach an appropriately higher terminal rate,” they said.\nTrading on Monday will also hinge on Black Friday sales and further information on the virus outbreak in China, said Julian Emanuel, Evercore ISI’s chief equity and quantitative strategist.\nChina’s central bank on Friday cut the amount of cash lenders must hold in reserve for the second time this year, an escalation of support for an economy racked by surging Covid cases and a continued property downturn. US-listed Chinese stocks fell and posted their first weekly decline this month.\n“How effective that will prove to be when cities are seeing restrictions and effective lockdowns reimposed is hard to say,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda. “But combined with other measures to boost the property market and ease Covid curbs, the cut could be supportive over the medium term when growth remains highly uncertain.”\nEuropean Union diplomats, meanwhile, won’t meet on Friday or over the weekend to discuss the oil-price cap as divisions within the bloc remain entrenched, according to people familiar with the matter.

    "content": "European stocks gained and the dollar fell after Federal Reserve meeting minutes showed support for more moderate interest-rate increases.\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 Index extended its recent rally as the real estate sector outperformed, boosted by the prospects of slower rate hikes and analyst upgrades. Dr. Martens Plc shares plunged the most on record after the bootmaker’s sales and earnings missed expectations. An index of global stocks advanced for a third day.\nTrading volumes are lower due to the Thanksgiving holiday, with no cash US equity market trading. Wall Street futures rose after the S&P 500 closed at a two-month high Wednesday. Asia’s equities benchmark climbed.\nMinutes from the Fed gathering earlier this month indicated several officials backed the need to moderate the pace of rate hikes, even as some underscored the case for a higher terminal rate. This adds weight to expectations the central bank will raise rates by 50 basis points next month, ending a run of jumbo 75 basis point increases. \n“It was the start of a more different and dovish narrative from the Fed,” said Sunaina Sinha Haldea, global head of private capital advisory at Raymond James. “Is it a pivot? No, but are we seeing a slowdown in rate hikes and that path downwards towards rate cuts coming through? Yes. I think we will look back and say this was the peak of it.”\nData Wednesday also showed US business activity contracted and unemployment applications rose as the economy cools.\nA gauge of dollar strength fell further Thursday, taking declines into a third day. European bonds rallied as traders trimmed wagers on rate increases by the European Central Bank, with risk-sensitive Italian debt leading the gains. There is no trading in Treasuries due to the US holiday. \n“A few” ECB officials favored a smaller increase in interest rates in October to tackle record inflation, an account of their last meeting showed. Those who preferred a less aggressive step cited the fact that the hike was accompanied by other monetary-tightening measures, according to the account, published Thursday.\nOil edged lower as the European Union considered a higher-than-expected price cap on Russian crude and signs of a global slowdown increased. \nMeanwhile, Bank of America Corp. said its private clients are flocking to bonds and out of stocks amid fears of a looming recession. Bond funds attracted inflows for a 39th straight week, strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a note. The strategists favor holding bonds in the first half of 2023, with stocks becoming more attractive in the last six months of next year. \n“We stay bearish risk assets in the first half, set to turn bullish in the second half as narrative shifts from inflation and rate ‘shocks’ of 2022 to recession and credit ‘shocks’ in the first half 2023,” the strategists wrote. \nGold rose for a third day on the Fed minutes. The precious metal has been hurt by the US central bank’s aggressive monetary-tightening policy to curb inflation, which has pushed up bond yields and the dollar and in turn sent bullion tumbling about 16% from its March peak. \nIn Asian trading, mainland Chinese stocks underperformed as investors weighed the impact of record Covid-19 cases against signs of loosening monetary conditions. Official comments broadcast Wednesday indicated the People’s Bank of China would allow banks to reduce capital reserves to stimulate growth.\nKey events this week:\nECB publishes account of its October policy meeting, ThursdayUS stock and bond markets are closed for the Thanksgiving holiday, ThursdayUS stock and bond markets close early, Friday\nECB publishes account of its October policy meeting, Thursday\nUS stock and bond markets are closed for the Thanksgiving holiday, Thursday\nUS stock and bond markets close early, Friday\nMLIV PulseDo you think investors are too bullish or too bearish about assets next year?

    "body": "<body>\n <p>\n  European stocks gained and the dollar fell after Federal Reserve meeting minutes showed support for more moderate interest-rate increases.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index extended its recent rally as the real estate sector outperformed, boosted by the prospects of slower rate hikes and analyst upgrades. Dr. Martens Plc shares plunged the most on record after the bootmaker’s sales and earnings missed expectations. An index of global stocks advanced for a third day.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Trading volumes are lower due to the Thanksgiving holiday, with no cash US equity market trading. Wall Street futures rose after the S&amp;P 500 closed at a two-month high Wednesday. Asia’s equities benchmark climbed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Minutes from the Fed gathering earlier this month indicated several officials backed the need to moderate the pace of rate hikes, even as some underscored the case for a higher terminal rate. This adds weight to expectations the central bank will raise rates by 50 basis points next month, ending a run of jumbo 75 basis point increases.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “It was the start of a more different and dovish narrative from the Fed,” said Sunaina Sinha Haldea, global head of private capital advisory at Raymond James. “Is it a pivot? No, but are we seeing a slowdown in rate hikes and that path downwards towards rate cuts coming through? Yes. I think we will look back and say this was the peak of it.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  Data Wednesday also showed US business activity contracted and unemployment applications rose as the economy cools.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A gauge of dollar strength fell further Thursday, taking declines into a third day. European bonds rallied as traders trimmed wagers on rate increases by the European Central Bank, with risk-sensitive Italian debt leading the gains. There is no trading in Treasuries due to the US holiday.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “A few” ECB officials favored a smaller increase in interest rates in October to tackle record inflation, an account of their last meeting showed. Those who preferred a less aggressive step cited the fact that the hike was accompanied by other monetary-tightening measures, according to the account, published Thursday.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Oil edged lower as the European Union considered a higher-than-expected price cap on Russian crude and signs of a global slowdown increased.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Meanwhile, Bank of America Corp. said its private clients are flocking to bonds and out of stocks amid fears of a looming recession. Bond funds attracted inflows for a 39th straight week, strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a note. The strategists favor holding bonds in the first half of 2023, with stocks becoming more attractive in the last six months of next year.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “We stay bearish risk assets in the first half, set to turn bullish in the second half as narrative shifts from inflation and rate ‘shocks’ of 2022 to recession and credit ‘shocks’ in the first half 2023,” the strategists wrote.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gold rose for a third day on the Fed minutes. The precious metal has been hurt by the US central bank’s aggressive monetary-tightening policy to curb inflation, which has pushed up bond yields and the dollar and in turn sent bullion tumbling about 16% from its March peak.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In Asian trading, mainland Chinese stocks underperformed as investors weighed the impact of record Covid-19 cases against signs of loosening monetary conditions. Official comments broadcast Wednesday indicated the People’s Bank of China would allow banks to reduce capital reserves to stimulate growth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Key events this week:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   ECB publishes account of its October policy meeting, Thursday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   US stock and bond markets are closed for the Thanksgiving holiday, Thursday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   US stock and bond markets close early, Friday\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <table>\n  <tr>\n   <th>\n    MLIV Pulse\n   </th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n    Do you think investors are too bullish or too bearish about assets next year?

    "content": "US stocks rallied on Tuesday as investors adjusted their expectations in response to Federal Reserve officials indicating that they’ll continue to raise interest rates but are open to slowing their tempo. \nThe S&P 500 closed at its highest level since Sept. 12. The Nasdaq 100 rose more than 1%. Upbeat earnings from a handful of retailers including Best Buy Co. and Abercrombie & Fitch Co. boosted sentiment during the trading session. Nordstrom Inc., which reported lackluster results after markets closed, fell in late trading.\nTreasuries rallied, with the benchmark 10-year yield around 3.76%. Oil rose amid an uncertain supply outlook alongside a proposal by the European Union to soften Russian crude sanctions. The dollar snapped a three-day climb. \nIn recent days, Fed officials have broadly maintained their steadfast stance to fight inflation. Yet San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly also said that officials need to be mindful of the lags in the transmission of policy changes, while her Cleveland counterpart Loretta Mester said she’s open to moderating the size of rate hikes. On Tuesday, the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Survey came in slightly below expectations, with data confirming the peak inflation narrative. \n“We think the Fed leadership wants to get off the 75-basis-point-a-meeting hamster wheel even though it is finding it hard to do so while maintaining control of financial conditions,” Evercore ISI’s Krishna Guha wrote in a note. “We think the Fed is still heading for a ‘hawkish slowing.’ And, for us at least, the slowing part is what matters.”\nDespite hints of moderation, the Fed is likely to raise its estimate of the terminal rate as early as December, in part because inflation may prove sticky, said Sonia Meskin, head of US macro at BNY Mellon Investment Management.\n“I don’t know if I would read too much into the sort of daily repricing from the macro perspective at this stage, but I would be interested to see the labor market data for November and then any indication of whether this information weakening is sustained or not,” Meskin said by phone. “I think those would really be more indicative of the future of the policy trajectory.” \nThanksgiving week in the US also tends to carry a “historically bullish tone” for stocks, Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler, said in a note. The week has started with a dip on Monday and then improves around the Thursday holiday about 68% of the time since 1950, he said. \nDespite Tuesday’s rally, China’s Covid control restrictions are still weighing on investors. Shutdowns can have a negative impact on supply-chain dynamics and possibly exacerbate inflation issues across economies. These restrictions now impact a fifth of China’s economy. Chinese stocks listed in the US fell on Tuesday for a third straight session. \nMeanwhile, the OECD said the world’s central banks must continue to raise rates to fight inflation, even as the global economy sinks into a significant slowdown. The unexpected surge in prices and its impact on real incomes is hurting people everywhere, creating problems that will only worsen if policy makers fail to act, the Paris-based organization said.\nKey events this week:\nS&P Global PMIs: US, Euro area, UK, WednesdayUS MBA mortgage applications, durable goods, initial jobless claims, University of Michigan sentiment, new home sales, WednesdayMinutes of the Federal Reserve’s Nov. 1-2 meeting, WednesdayECB publishes account of its October policy meeting, ThursdayUS stock and bond markets are closed for the Thanksgiving holiday, ThursdayUS stock and bond markets close early, Friday\nS&P Global PMIs: US, Euro area, UK, Wednesday\nUS MBA mortgage applications, durable goods, initial jobless claims, University of Michigan sentiment, new home sales, Wednesday\nMinutes of the Federal Reserve’s Nov. 1-2 meeting, Wednesday\nECB publishes account of its October policy meeting, Thursday\nUS stock and bond markets are closed for the Thanksgiving holiday, Thursday\nUS stock and bond markets close early, Friday\nMLIV PulseDo you think investors are too bullish or too bearish about assets next year?

The unexpected surge in prices and its impact on real incomes is hurting people everywhere, creating problems that will only worsen if policy makers fail to act, the Paris-based organization said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Key events this week:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   S&amp;P Global PMIs: US, Euro area, UK, Wednesday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   US MBA mortgage applications, durable goods, initial jobless claims, University of Michigan sentiment, new home sales, Wednesday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s Nov. 1-2 meeting, Wednesday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   ECB publishes account of its October policy meeting, Thursday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   US stock and bond markets are closed for the Thanksgiving holiday, Thursday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   US stock and bond markets close early, Friday\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <table>\n  <tr>\n   <th>\n    MLIV Pulse\n   </th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n    Do you think investors are too bullish or too bearish about assets next year?

    "content": "US stocks dropped as investors parsed comments from Federal Reserve officials who broadly remained steadfast in their fight against inflation. Mounting concerns that China may tighten Covid curbs after a string of reported deaths also continued to weigh on investors.\nTechnology stocks, which are typically more sensitive to interest rates, dragged the S&P 500 lower. The Nasdaq 100 ended the day down 1.1%. Oil emerged from a volatile session largely unchanged after Saudi Arabia denied a report that it is discussing an oil-production increase for the OPEC+ meeting next month. The dollar climbed for a third day as investors sought haven assets. Treasuries were mixed. \nInvestors are closely watching what Fed speakers say about the outlook for interest rates. While several central bank officials in recent days have restated their intention to remain relentless until inflation is under control, they differ on how far they’ll go. On Monday, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said that officials will need to be mindful of the lags with which monetary policy is transmitted through the economy as they raise rates further. Her Cleveland counterpart Loretta Mester said she’s open to slowing the tempo of rate hikes. \n“This shouldn’t be regarded as a pivot or anything new,” said Michael Contopoulos, director of fixed income at Richard Bernstein Advisors. “A real pivot is when the Fed starts to cut rates and/or pause quantitative tightening. That is nowhere in sight.”\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, meanwhile, has said he favors slowing the pace of interest rate increases, with no more than 1 percentage point more of hikes, to try to ensure the economy has a soft landing. Boston Fed President Susan Collins has reiterated her view that options are open for the size of the December interest-rate increase, including the possibility of a 75 basis-point move. \nTraders this week will also be looking to minutes of the most recent Fed policy meeting for further clues on the central bank’s path ahead. \n“For the Fed right now, if we do get some slowing in inflation -- which it seems like we might -- but you’re not seeing it in the slowing of service inflation, that’s related to a tight labor market,” Veronica Clark, economist at Citigroup, said on Bloomberg Television. “You do need to see that loosening in the labor market data.” \nMeanwhile, China saw its first Covid-related death in almost six months on Saturday and another two were reported on Sunday. Worsening outbreaks across the nation are stoking concerns that authorities may again resort to harsh restrictions. Shutdowns could have a negative impact on supply-chain dynamics and possibly exacerbate inflation issues across economies. \nKey events this week:\nUS Richmond Fed manufacturing index, TuesdayOECD releases Economic Outlook, TuesdayFed’s Loretta Mester and James Bullard speak, TuesdayS&P Global PMIs: US, Euro area, UK, WednesdayUS MBA mortgage applications, durable goods, initial jobless claims, University of Michigan sentiment, new home sales, WednesdayMinutes of the Federal Reserve’s Nov. 1-2 meeting, WednesdayECB publishes account of its October policy meeting, ThursdayUS stock and bond markets are closed for the Thanksgiving holiday, ThursdayUS stock and bond markets close early, Friday\nUS Richmond Fed manufacturing index, Tuesday\nOECD releases Economic Outlook, Tuesday\nFed’s Loretta Mester and James Bullard speak, Tuesday\nS&P Global PMIs: US, Euro area, UK, Wednesday\nUS MBA mortgage applications, durable goods, initial jobless claims, University of Michigan sentiment, new home sales, Wednesday\nMinutes of the Federal Reserve’s Nov. 1-2 meeting, Wednesday\nECB publishes account of its October policy meeting, Thursday\nUS stock and bond markets are closed for the Thanksgiving holiday, Thursday\nUS stock and bond markets close early, Friday\nSome of the main moves in markets :\nStocks\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.4% as of 4:01 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 fell 1.1%The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%The MSCI World index rose 0.6%\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.4% as of 4:01 p.m. New York time\nThe Nasdaq 100 fell 1.1%\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%\nThe MSCI World index rose 0.6%\nCurrencies\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.7%The euro fell 0.8% to $1.0239The British pound fell 0.6% to $1.1818The Japanese yen fell 1.2% to 142.11 per dollar\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.7%\nThe euro fell 0.8% to $1.0239\nThe British pound fell 0.6% to $1.1818\nThe Japanese yen fell 1.2% to 142.11 per dollar\nCryptocurrencies\nBitcoin fell 2.8% to $15,800.01Ether fell 3.2% to $1,104.71\nBitcoin fell 2.8% to $15,800.01\nEther fell 3.2% to $1,104.71\nBonds\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 3.83%Germany’s 10-year yield declined two basis points to 1.99%Britain’s 10-year yield declined five basis points to 3.19%\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 3.83%\nGermany’s 10-year yield declined two basis points to 1.99%\nBritain’s 10-year yield declined five basis points to 3.19%\nCommodities\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.4% to $79.73 a barrelGold futures fell 0.8% to $1,755.20 an ounce\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.4% to $79.73 a barrel\nGold futures fell 0.8% to $1,755.20 an ounce\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n",

    "content": "US stocks dropped after strong retail sales data and comments from at least two Federal Reserve speakers recast bets that the central bank’s policy tightening regime is nearing an end. \nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 fell after a report showed retail sales posted the biggest increase in eight months in October, outpacing estimates and indicating the economy can withstand additional Fed hikes. Target Corp.’s disappointing earnings also weighed on sentiment. \nThe indexes trimmed their losses after 4 p.m. in New York, when a fresh batch of earnings trickled in. Nvidia Corp. posted quarterly sales that topped analysts’ estimates while Cisco Systems Inc. gave a bullish revenue forecast.\nA closely watched part of the US yield curve reached new extremes of inversion, signaling concerns that restrictive Fed policy will sap the economy. \nWednesday’s market pullback came after a hefty rally stoked by softer-than-expected US inflation data that fanned hopes the Fed may be able to slow its tempo of interest-rate hikes. While a slew of Fed officials in recent days have backed these expectations, they have also emphasized the need to keep hiking into next year. \nOn Wednesday, New York Fed President John Williams bruised sentiment after he said the central bank should avoid incorporating financial stability risks into its considerations. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, meanwhile, stressed that a pause is “off the table.” \nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. now expects the Fed to boost its key rate to a range of 5% to 5.25%, up from the previous call of 4.75% to 5%. \n“The market is just trying to grasp for news and it’s prone to overcompensate for the news, whether it’s good news or bad news,” Sandi Bragar, chief client officer at Aspiriant, said by phone. “We’re just at that point in the cycle where we think there’s still the high likelihood for potential downward trajectory of stocks as we head into 2023.”\nThe stronger retail numbers give the Fed more room to be aggressive, as officials have consistently communicated, Oksana Aronov, alternative fixed income head of markets strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management, said on Bloomberg TV. The disparate economic data that has hit the markets in recent weeks complicates the central bank’s mandate, she said.\n \nEarlier in the day, comments from US President Joe Biden that Ukrainian air defenses, rather than by Russia, had likely caused Tuesday’s explosion in Poland soothed fears of an escalation in military conflict. While the White House backed Poland’s call on the matter, it emphasized that Russia was ultimately to blame.\nElsewhere, European Central Bank policy makers may slow down their tempo of rate hikes, with only a 50 basis-point increase next month, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\nMLIV Pulse SurveyWho will win the World Cup and which country will have the best-performing stock market during the tournament?

    "content": "US stocks ended a choppy session lower after two Federal Reserve officials highlighted the central bank’s resolve to be persistent until it brings inflation down meaningfully. \nThe S&P 500 was down 0.9%, snapping a two-day rally. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 also fell. Treasury yields climbed, with the 10-year rate around 3.87%.\nFed Vice Chair Lael Brainard briefly buoyed sentiment after she said, during a Bloomberg event in Washington, that it would be appropriate “soon” for the central bank to slow its pace of interest-rate hikes. However, she also emphasized that the Fed had “additional work to do” to bring inflation down, which kept some investors on the edge. Brainard did not explicitly commit to a step-down to a half-point hike in December, nor did she elaborate what she meant by “soon.”\n“I think Brainard’s comments underscore the uncertainty of the path forward and the data dependence of the Committee,” said Jake Schurmeier, portfolio manager at Harbor Capital Advisors. “They don’t want a slower pace of rate hikes to be confused for less restrictive policy.”\nEarlier, Fed Governor Christopher Waller’s hawkish comments wobbled markets as investors mulled whether the post-CPI euphoria was overblown. \nLast week’s CPI-fueled rally, which propelled the S&P 500 to its best week since June, may be unsustainable, according to Christopher Smart, chief global strategist at Barings and head of the Barings Investment Institute.\n“The bad news is that in an economic moment that remains so uncertain, the data is more likely than not to be messy and contradictory in the months ahead. The pace of decline will be uneven,” he said. “Moreover, there’s still a long way to go to get to the Fed’s target of 2% average inflation. That’s why Fed governors have been lining up to talk down any market euphoria that a real pivot is in sight.” \nThe cumulative impact of prior interest-rate hikes will also continue to weigh on economic growth and corporate profits, according to Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, who recommends that investors take a defensive position. \nMeanwhile, Chinese stocks listed in the US extended their rally to a third day, after Joe Biden and Xi Jinping called for reduced tensions between the world’s two biggest economies during a meeting in Bali, Indonesia. \nKey events this week:\nFed’s John Williams moderates panel, MondayChina retail sales, industrial production, surveyed jobless, TuesdayFormer US President Donald Trump plans to make an announcement, TuesdayUS empire manufacturing, PPI, TuesdayUS business inventories, cross-border investment, retail sales, industrial production, WednesdayFed’s John Williams, Lael Brainard and SEC Chair Gary Gensler speak, WednesdayECB President Christine Lagarde speaks, WednesdayEurozone CPI, ThursdayUS housing starts, initial jobless claims, ThursdayFed’s Neel Kashkari, Loretta Mester speak, ThursdayUS Conference Board leading index, existing home sales, Friday\nFed’s John Williams moderates panel, Monday\nChina retail sales, industrial production, surveyed jobless, Tuesday\nFormer US President Donald Trump plans to make an announcement, Tuesday\nUS empire manufacturing, PPI, Tuesday\nUS business inventories, cross-border investment, retail sales, industrial production, Wednesday\nFed’s John Williams, Lael Brainard and SEC Chair Gary Gensler speak, Wednesday\nECB President Christine Lagarde speaks, Wednesday\nEurozone CPI, Thursday\nUS housing starts, initial jobless claims, Thursday\nFed’s Neel Kashkari, Loretta Mester speak, Thursday\nUS Conference Board leading index, existing home sales, Friday\nSome of the main moves in markets:\nStocks\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.9% as of 4 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 fell 1%The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6%The MSCI World index rose 1.8%\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.9% as of 4 p.m. New York time\nThe Nasdaq 100 fell 1%\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6%\nThe MSCI World index rose 1.8%\nCurrencies\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.2%The euro fell 0.1% to $1.0333The British pound fell 0.6% to $1.1758The Japanese yen fell 0.7% to 139.74 per dollar\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.2%\nThe euro fell 0.1% to $1.0333\nThe British pound fell 0.6% to $1.1758\nThe Japanese yen fell 0.7% to 139.74 per dollar\nCryptocurrencies\nBitcoin fell 0.7% to $16,246.64Ether fell 0.2% to $1,213.63\nBitcoin fell 0.7% to $16,246.64\nEther fell 0.2% to $1,213.63\nBonds\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced six basis points to 3.87%Germany’s 10-year yield declined one basis point to 2.15%Britain’s 10-year yield advanced one basis point to 3.37%\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced six basis points to 3.87%\nGermany’s 10-year yield declined one basis point to 2.15%\nBritain’s 10-year yield advanced one basis point to 3.37%\nCommodities\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 4.1% to $85.30 a barrelGold futures rose 0.4% to $1,776.30 an ounce\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 4.1% to $85.30 a barrel\nGold futures rose 0.4% to $1,776.30 an ounce\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n",

Brainard did not explicitly commit to a step-down to a half-point hike in December, nor did she elaborate what she meant by “soon.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  “I think Brainard’s comments underscore the uncertainty of the path forward and the data dependence of the Committee,” said Jake Schurmeier, portfolio manager at Harbor Capital Advisors. “They don’t want a slower pace of rate hikes to be confused for less restrictive policy.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  Earlier, Fed Governor Christopher Waller’s hawkish comments wobbled markets as investors mulled whether the post-CPI euphoria was overblown.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Last week’s CPI-fueled rally, which propelled the S&amp;P 500 to its best week since June, may be unsustainable, according to Christopher Smart, chief global strategist at Barings and head of the Barings Investment Institute.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “The bad news is that in an economic moment that remains so uncertain, the data is more likely than not to be messy and contradictory in the months ahead. The pace of decline will be uneven,” he said. “Moreover, there’s still a long way to go to get to the Fed’s target of 2% average inflation. That’s why Fed governors have been lining up to talk down any market euphoria that a real pivot is in sight.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  The cumulative impact of prior interest-rate hikes will also continue to weigh on economic growth and corporate profits, according to Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, who recommends that investors take a defensive position.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Meanwhile, Chinese stocks listed in the US extended their rally to a third day, after Joe Biden and Xi Jinping called for reduced tensions between the world’s two biggest economies during a meeting in Bali, Indonesia.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Key events this week:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Fed’s John Williams moderates panel, Monday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   China retail sales, industrial production, surveyed jobless, Tuesday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Former US President Donald Trump plans to make an announcement, Tuesday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   US empire manufacturing, PPI, Tuesday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   US business inventories, cross-border investment, retail sales, industrial production, Wednesday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Fed’s John Williams, Lael Brainard and SEC Chair Gary Gensler speak, Wednesday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   ECB President Christine Lagarde speaks, Wednesday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Eurozone CPI, Thursday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   US housing starts, initial jobless claims, Thursday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Fed’s Neel Kashkari, Loretta Mester speak, Thursday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   US Conference Board leading index, existing home sales, Friday\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Some of the main moves in markets:\n </p>\n <h3>\n  Stocks\n </h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.9% as of 4 p.m. New York time\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The Nasdaq 100 fell 1%\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6%\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The MSCI World index rose 1.8%\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <h3>\n  Currencies\n </h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.2%\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The euro fell 0.1% to $1.0333\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The British pound fell 0.6% to $1.1758\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The Japanese yen fell 0.7% to 139.74 per dollar\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <h3>\n  Cryptocurrencies\n </h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Bitcoin fell 0.7% to $16,246.64\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Ether fell 0.2% to $1,213.63\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <h3>\n  Bonds\n </h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced six basis points to 3.87%\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Germany’s 10-year yield declined one basis point to 2.15%\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Britain’s 10-year yield advanced one basis point to 3.37%\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <h3>\n  Commodities\n </h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   West Texas Intermediate crude fell 4.1% to $85.30 a barrel\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,776.30 an ounce\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  This story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n </p>\n <ol>\n </ol>\n</body>"

The dollar fell, declining for a fourth week.\nThe S&P 500 closed near session highs in the biggest weekly gain since June. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 climbed more than 1.5%, notching its best week in two years. Cash Treasury trading is closed for Veterans Day.\nElsewhere, China easing some Covid restrictions helped underpin risk sentiment Friday, with US-listed Chinese stocks rising along with commodities from oil to soybeans to precious metals.\nMeanwhile, cryptocurrencies resumed a selloff amid FTX’s deepening woes with Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire filing for bankruptcy. While that news weighed on sentiment in early trading, investors downplayed contagion risks. \n“From my vantage point, the real-world impact seems somewhat limited,” said Dan Suzuki, deputy chief investment officer at Richard Bernstein Advisors LLC. “It’s hard to imagine how it has a big impact on the overall economy.

    "content": "Wall Street contended with another volatile session as investors mulled the Federal Reserve’s path of interest-rate hikes while assessing mixed economic data and a slew of earnings reports. \nAmazon.com Inc. plunged after hours as its sales forecast trailed estimates. Shares of Apple Inc. struggled for direction postmarket after it reported weaker-than-expected iPhone and services sales in its latest quarter. \nThe S&P 500 closed lower, after swinging between gains and losses for most of the session. The Nasdaq 100 fell more than 1% in regular trading and an exchange-traded fund tracking it slid further after 4 p.m. in New York. Lackluster earnings from several megacap firms this week dampened sentiment and underscored the impact of the Fed’s tightening regime. Meta Platforms Inc. posted its worst one-day drop since February on Thursday, triggered by burgeoning metaverse costs and a decline in revenue.\nMarkets were also mixed on US gross domestic product data. The report showed the US economy rebounded after two quarterly contractions, which briefly assuaged concerns of an imminent recession. But it also highlighted that consumer spending remains under pressure because of inflation. Treasuries gained, with the 10-year yield pushing below 4% on speculation of a Fed pivot. The dollar snapped a two-day drop.  \nThe stock and currency markets digested the GDP data differently because it’s difficult to tell what the Fed is planning to do next, said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index.\n“The US dollar is reading into this that perhaps it’s going to keep the Fed on that hawkish path for longer,” Cincotta said by phone. “Whereas the stock market seems to be reading it completely differently, almost as if it’s expecting the Fed to be sort of moving toward that less hawkish stuff.”\nEconomists still expect the Fed to hike by three-quarters of a percentage point for the fourth time in a row when it meets next week. But with recent data highlighting the effects of the Fed’s sharp rate hikes on the economy, investors expect the central bank to slow its pace of tightening after November’s meeting.  \n“It’s not about a pivot and cutting interest rates,” Alec Young, chief investment strategist at MAPsignals, said in an interview. “It’s just about the Fed becoming more data-dependent and acknowledging there’s already a lot of tightening in the pipeline from all the rate hikes they’ve put through so far.”\nEarlier, the European Central Bank lifted its policy rate by 75 basis points -- in line with expectations -- and signaled more tightening ahead. But ECB officials weren’t unanimous about the size of the interest-rate hike and sought to avoid giving a specific signal on their next move in December, according to people familiar with the matter.\nShare your views on key ESG themesESG is one of the largest, and most debated, investment approaches in markets today.

    "content": "US stocks rallied for a second straight session as investors geared up for some of the world’s biggest companies to report earnings this week. Traders also mulled whether the Federal Reserve will slow its pace of interest-rate hikes after assessing weak economic data that released Monday. \nMore than 80% of stocks in the S&P 500 index closed in green on Monday, buoyed by gains in technology and health-care companies. The Nasdaq 100 also rose more than 1%. US-listed Chinese shares plunged after that nation’s equity index tumbled as President Xi Jinping solidified his power. Among the megacap companies slated to report earnings this week are Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. \nUS Treasury 10-year yields ended the session around 4.25%. UK bonds posted some of their biggest gains on record as investors expect incoming Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to repair the damage caused by predecessor Liz Truss after her massive package of unfunded tax cuts roiled financial markets. \nEarnings remain in focus in the US, with investors still on edge over whether companies that are among the key profit-growth engines for the S&P 500 can deliver profits with inflation crimping margins. Of the almost 20% of companies that have reported so far, roughly 58% posted positive surprises in both revenue and earnings per share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. As the Fed attempts to stomp out inflation, latest earnings displaying resilience and showing few signs of recession may be making some investors uneasy on equities. \n“Over the short-term, we think we can get some relief. The fact that earnings season has also been relatively strong is also helpful,” Andrew Sheets, Morgan Stanley’s chief cross-asset strategist, said on Bloomberg Television. “But the big picture -- and I don’t think this changes -- is that we still view this as a bear market rally rather than the start of a larger new bull market.”\nFed policy is also still a key focus for investors. Data on Monday indicated that Fed tightening is starting to hit the economy, with Purchasing Managers’ Index indicators showing contraction in the services and manufacturing sectors. Reports that the Fed may soon start reducing the size of its rate hikes had pushed stocks higher by more than 2% on Friday. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly’s comments on Friday also added to the tentative optimism. But some investors are still cautious in their expectations that the central bank is moderating its rhetoric. \n“We are still agnostic as to whether the Fed really is going to pivot or be at the peak of its hawkish cycle,” said Lisa Erickson, senior vice president and head of public markets group at US Bank Wealth Management. “If you look at the underlying data, inflation remains sticky, particularly in services ex-housing, which can often be more persistent. So given the Fed’s dependence on the data, we’re not clear exactly again, when the Fed may truly begin to slow down.”\nThe central bank needs to maintain a balance between addressing inflation and reacting appropriately to any signs of slowdown in inflation, Erickson said. \nKey events this week:\nEarnings due this week include: Apple, Microsoft, Exxon Mobil, Ford Motor, Credit Suisse, Airbus, Alphabet, Amazon, Bank of China, Boeing, Caterpillar, Cnooc, Coca-Cola, HSBC, Intel, McDonald’s, Mercedes-Benz, Merck, Samsung Electronics, Shell, UBS, UPS, Vale, Visa, VolkswagenUS Conference Board consumer confidence, TuesdayBank of Canada rate decision, WednesdayECB rate decision, ThursdayUS GDP, durable goods orders, initial jobless claims, ThursdayBank of Japan policy decision, FridayUS personal income, personal spending, pending home sales, University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Friday\nEarnings due this week include: Apple, Microsoft, Exxon Mobil, Ford Motor, Credit Suisse, Airbus, Alphabet, Amazon, Bank of China, Boeing, Caterpillar, Cnooc, Coca-Cola, HSBC, Intel, McDonald’s, Mercedes-Benz, Merck, Samsung Electronics, Shell, UBS, UPS, Vale, Visa, Volkswagen\nUS Conference Board consumer confidence, Tuesday\nBank of Canada rate decision, Wednesday\nECB rate decision, Thursday\nUS GDP, durable goods orders, initial jobless claims, Thursday\nBank of Japan policy decision, Friday\nUS personal income, personal spending, pending home sales, University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Friday\nSome of the main moves in markets:\nStocks\nThe S&P 500 rose 1.2% as of 4 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 rose 1.1%The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3%The MSCI World index rose 1.2%\nThe S&P 500 rose 1.2% as of 4 p.m. New York time\nThe Nasdaq 100 rose 1.1%\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3%\nThe MSCI World index rose 1.2%\nCurrencies\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.4%The euro rose 0.1% to $0.9873The British pound fell 0.2% to $1.1279The Japanese yen fell 0.9% to 148.98 per dollar\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.4%\nThe euro rose 0.1% to $0.9873\nThe British pound fell 0.2% to $1.1279\nThe Japanese yen fell 0.9% to 148.98 per dollar\nCryptocurrencies\nBitcoin fell 0.8% to $19,341.76Ether rose 1.1% to $1,344.95\nBitcoin fell 0.8% to $19,341.76\nEther rose 1.1% to $1,344.95\nBonds\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced three basis points to 4.25%Germany’s 10-year yield declined nine basis points to 2.33%Britain’s 10-year yield declined 31 basis points to 3.75%\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced three basis points to 4.25%\nGermany’s 10-year yield declined nine basis points to 2.33%\nBritain’s 10-year yield declined 31 basis points to 3.75%\nCommodities\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.5% to $84.66 a barrelGold futures fell 0.1% to $1,654.20 an ounce\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.5% to $84.66 a barrel\nGold futures fell 0.1% to $1,654.20 an ounce\n",
    "body": "<body>\n <p>\n  US stocks rallied for a second straight session as investors geared up for some of the world’s biggest companies to report earnings this week. Traders also mulled whether the Federal Reserve will slow its pace of interest-rate hikes after assessing weak economic data that released Monday.\n </p>\n <p>\n  More than 80% of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index closed in green on Monday, buoyed by gains in technology and health-care companies. The Nasdaq 100 also rose more than 1%. US-listed Chinese shares plunged after that nation’s equity index tumbled as President Xi Jinping solidified his power. Among the megacap companies slated to report earnings this week are Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  US Treasury 10-year yields ended the session around 4.25%. UK bonds posted some of their biggest gains on record as investors expect incoming Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to repair the damage caused by predecessor Liz Truss after her massive package of unfunded tax cuts roiled financial markets.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Earnings remain in focus in the US, with investors still on edge over whether companies that are among the key profit-growth engines for the S&amp;P 500 can deliver profits with inflation crimping margins. Of the almost 20% of companies that have reported so far, roughly 58% posted positive surprises in both revenue and earnings per share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. As the Fed attempts to stomp out inflation, latest earnings displaying resilience and showing few signs of recession may be making some investors uneasy on equities.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “Over the short-term, we think we can get some relief. The fact that earnings season has also been relatively strong is also helpful,” Andrew Sheets, Morgan Stanley’s chief cross-asset strategist, said on Bloomberg Television. “But the big picture -- and I don’t think this changes -- is that we still view this as a bear market rally rather than the start of a larger new bull market.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fed policy is also still a key focus for investors. Data on Monday indicated that Fed tightening is starting to hit the economy, with Purchasing Managers’ Index indicators showing contraction in the services and manufacturing sectors. Reports that the Fed may soon start reducing the size of its rate hikes had pushed stocks higher by more than 2% on Friday. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly’s comments on Friday also added to the tentative optimism. But some investors are still cautious in their expectations that the central bank is moderating its rhetoric.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “We are still agnostic as to whether the Fed really is going to pivot or be at the peak of its hawkish cycle,” said Lisa Erickson, senior vice president and head of public markets group at US Bank Wealth Management. “If you look at the underlying data, inflation remains sticky, particularly in services ex-housing, which can often be more persistent.

    "content": "Stocks saw big gains Monday, with the S&P 500 closing above a key technical level and another giant bank coming out with solid results. A reversal of the UK’s vast fiscal stimulus also bolstered trader sentiment.\nThe breadth of the rally was so strong that at one point over 99% of the companies in the US equity benchmark were up, with the gauge pushing away from its 200-week moving average. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 outperformed, notching its biggest gain since July.\nA rout in the S&P 500 has left the index testing a “serious floor of support,” which could lead to a technical recovery, Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson wrote. The strategist, who’s one of Wall Street’s most-prominent bearish voices, said he “would not rule out” the measure rising to about 4,150. That’s 13% above current levels.\n“Stocks may be ripe for a near-term bounce,” wrote BCA Research strategists led by Roukaya Ibrahim. “While economic conditions have not changed -- and therefore do not warrant a shift in the cyclical outlook -- technical conditions are pointing to a potential rebound.” \nThe arrival of earnings has historically served as a remedy for ailing equities, lifting the S&P 500 roughly 76% of the time since 2013. Cut-to-bone profit estimates are making the hurdles easy to clear. \nTo Jeffrey Buchbinder at LPL Financial, while expectations are indeed very low for the current earnings season, forecasts for 2023 still remain elevated. \n“The tough part is figuring out how far estimates need to fall and how much of a headwind that haircut will be for stocks as they try to dig their way out of this bear market,” he added.\nMarkets have historically bottomed out when investors began to contemplate materially looser policy over the next six to 12 months, when a trough for economic activity was in sight or when valuations reflected a “bear case” scenario, according to Mark Haefele at UBS Global Wealth Management.\n“We do not believe these conditions have been fulfilled,” Haefele added. “Despite the increased risks to growth and the rise in volatility, equity markets have neither become cheaper relative to bonds, nor yet priced in a material slowdown in growth and earnings.”\nSome 86% of respondents in the latest MLIV Pulse survey expect US markets to recover first, with investors slightly favoring stocks over bonds. The result suggests the longstanding premium for equities will remain in place — and as the Federal Reserve’s peak hawkishness becomes apparent, traders will be prepared to return to Treasury markets in droves.\nThe latest US recession probability models by Bloomberg economists Anna Wong and Eliza Winger forecast a higher probability of such an event across all time frames -- with the 12-month estimate of a downturn by October 2023 hitting 100%. That’s up from 65% for the comparable period in the previous update.\nData Monday showed a measure of New York state manufacturing contracted for a third month in October, and a larger share of factories were more downbeat about business conditions in early 2023. The prices-paid measure rose for the first time since June.\n“This isn’t a Pollyanna moment,” said Robert Teeter, a managing director of Silvercrest Asset Management. “Inflation clearly remains a problem until proven otherwise, and disappointing earnings, particularly from consumer facing-companies, could trigger another rough stretch, with recession fears at the fore.”\nKey events this week:\nUS industrial production, NAHB housing market index, TuesdayFed’s Neel Kashkari speaks, TuesdayEuro area CPI, WednesdayEIA crude oil inventory report, WednesdayUS MBA mortgage applications, building permits, housing starts, Fed Beige Book, WednesdayFed’s Neel Kashkari, Charles Evans, James Bullard speak, WednesdayUS existing home sales, initial jobless claims, Conference Board leading index, ThursdayEuro area consumer confidence, Friday\nUS industrial production, NAHB housing market index, Tuesday\nFed’s Neel Kashkari speaks, Tuesday\nEuro area CPI, Wednesday\nEIA crude oil inventory report, Wednesday\nUS MBA mortgage applications, building permits, housing starts, Fed Beige Book, Wednesday\nFed’s Neel Kashkari, Charles Evans, James Bullard speak, Wednesday\nUS existing home sales, initial jobless claims, Conference Board leading index, Thursday\nEuro area consumer confidence, Friday\nSome of the main moves in markets:\nStocks\nThe S&P 500 rose 2.7% as of 4 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 rose 3.5%The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.9%The MSCI World index rose 2.1%\nThe S&P 500 rose 2.7% as of 4 p.m. New York time\nThe Nasdaq 100 rose 3.5%\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.9%\nThe MSCI World index rose 2.1%\nCurrencies\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.7%The euro rose 1.2% to $0.9837The British pound rose 1.6% to $1.1352The Japanese yen fell 0.2% to 149.04 per dollar\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.7%\nThe euro rose 1.2% to $0.9837\nThe British pound rose 1.6% to $1.1352\nThe Japanese yen fell 0.2% to 149.04 per dollar\nCryptocurrencies\nBitcoin rose 1% to $19,527.35Ether rose 1.1% to $1,325.63\nBitcoin rose 1% to $19,527.35\nEther rose 1.1% to $1,325.63\nBonds\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 4.02%Germany’s 10-year yield declined eight basis points to 2.27%Britain’s 10-year yield declined 36 basis points to 3.98%\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 4.02%\nGermany’s 10-year yield declined eight basis points to 2.27%\nBritain’s 10-year yield declined 36 basis points to 3.98%\nCommodities\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.2% to $85.40 a barrelGold futures rose 0.3% to $1,653.70 an ounce\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.2% to $85.40 a barrel\nGold futures rose 0.3% to $1,653.70 an ounce\n",

The dollar gained and Treasuries fell.\nThe S&P 500 closed near lows of the day, falling more than 2%. The growth-sensitive Nasdaq 100 posted the steepest losses, dropping just over 3% as Treasury yields climbed, with the two-year rate rising back to 4.5%. Both indexes posted their first weekly declines this month.\nEquity markets turned sharply lower after a University of Michigan survey showed year-ahead inflation expectations rose in early October and the long-term outlook also crept up. The uptick is potentially worrisome for the Federal Reserve’s efforts to keep views anchored. It also follows data a day earlier that showed a key measure of consumer prices accelerated in September to a 40-year high. On Thursday, however, stocks roared back from early losses in one of the biggest reversals on record.\n“Yesterday you had this amazing, powerful intraday rally that was completely wrong,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes. “Then you look at the Michigan numbers this morning that’s consistent with what we’re seeing in the economy, and the stock market now is down to reflect that number. That’s correct.”\nCorporate America offered some bright spots, with big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. rising after reporting results, while Morgan Stanley fell as equity trading revenue disappointed. UnitedHealth Group Inc. shares gained after the health-care giant beat profit forecasts in the third quarter and raised its outlook for the year.  \nRead more: Main Street Beating Wall Street Still Leaves Banks Facing Pain\nEarnings next week will provide clues on the strength of a swathe of companies, including Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Netflix Inc., Tesla Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc.\nIn the latest Fed comments, officials suggested they’re ready to hike rates higher than previously planned. Kansas City Fed President Esther George said the terminal rate may need to be higher to cool prices. San Francisco Fed’s Mary Daly said she’s “very supportive” raising to restrictive levels and to between 4.5% and 5% “is the most likely outcome.”\nForecasts they released last month showed rates reaching 4.4% by year end and 4.6% next year, from a current target range of 3% to 3.25. Swaps traders have boosted wagers for rate hikes over the past week following strong payrolls and hot inflation readings, with the market leaning toward back-to-back jumbo hikes at the next two meetings and a high above 4.9% next year.\n“A lot of investors are looking at inflation to get guidance on what the Fed is going to do, to find the bottom in the market once the Fed pivots,” Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer and president of First American Trust, said in an interview. “But looking at CPI, unemployment, there’s obviously a lot of heat in the economy. Inflation is going to take some time to come down.”\nIn the UK, bonds and the pound fell to end another tumultuous week. Gilts slid as Prime Minister Liz Truss confirmed speculation she will U-turn on a planned freeze on corporation tax. The Bank of England ended its emergency bond purchases on Friday, buying £1.45 billion of long-dated and inflation-linked gilts.

    "content": "US stocks roared back from losses sparked by a hot inflation reading on speculation the yearlong selloff had potentially reached a bottom. \nThe S&P 500 closed up 2.6% after swinging more than 5% during a wild trading day. The benchmark clawed back more than 40% of the losses over a six-day selloff that took it to a two-year low. \nTechnical levels factored into the bounce. At one point, the benchmark S&P 500 had given back 50% of its post-pandemic rally, triggering programmed buying. A wave of put options bought to protect against such a rout moved into the money, and as profits were booked, that prompted dealers to buy stocks to remain market neutral. \nA gauge of consumer price growth rose to a 40-year high last month, sealing the case for the Fed to deliver a large rate hike in November. Stocks plunged 25% this year before Thursday’s rebound, as the central bank tightened policy to curb inflation, leaving investors to weigh how much damage is left for share prices.\n“There may be some short covering going on, but also, a lot was priced in,” said Michael Contopoulos, director of fixed income at Richard Bernstein Advisors. “There has likely been a fair amount of defensive positioning lately in equities and on the rates side, higher policy rates means higher probability of a hard landing.”\nRead more: Big Hedges, 50% Charts, Okay Earnings: Behind the Stock Bounce\nRead more: Hot Inflation Torches Bears in a Stock Reversal for the Ages\nRisk assets have been under pressure all year as central banks around the world attempt to tame runaway inflation. The latest data added to evidence the harsh monetary medicine has yet to take hold and comes on the heels of last week’s payrolls figures that showed unemployment rate at a five-decade low in September.\nThe Treasury curve flattened, with the yield on policy-sensitive two-year notes up 18 basis points at 4.47%. Market bets on rates now lean toward back-to-back 75 basis-point hikes at the next two Fed meetings and expect the central bank to push rates past 4.85% before the tightening cycle ends. The current rate is 3.25%.\nOn the earnings front, Delta Air Lines Inc., Domino’s Pizza Inc. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. gained on better-than-expected results. Big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are due to report on Friday.\nMore market commentary\n“If you had some levered CTA who had a big buy program set to start around 3,505 and then another levered short who doubled down on the CPI print that could have created this snowball where market just ripped as other levered technical systematic traders piled in,” Max Gokhman, chief investment officer for AlphaTrAI, said. “Or someone just got a fat margin call. We may find out after the dust settles.”“There’s so much uncertainty in the market and so many data points are conflicting that the market responds to whatever is the most recent data point,” said Ellen Hazen, chief market strategist and portfolio manager at F.L.Putnam Investment Management. “So this morning with the reversal in the UK the market was up pre-open, then we got CPI and then it was down. And then we look at the fact that we bounced off of this support level and that becomes self-fulfilling.”“This isn’t the CPI report markets or the Fed were hoping for,” said James Athey, investment director at abrdn. “Inflation pressures remain stubbornly high. The reality is that for the foreseeable future the Fed is locked into a stance of unequivocal hawkishness. This will support bond yields and the US dollar but its yet more bad news for equities.”“After today’s inflation report, there can’t be anyone left in the market who believes the Fed can raise rates by anything less than 75bps at the November meeting,” Seema Shah, strategist at Principal Global Investors wrote. “In fact, if this kind of upside surprise is repeated next month, we could be facing a fifth consecutive 0.75% hike in December with policy rates blowing through the Fed’s peak rate forecast before this year is over.”Given the latest CPI report, “any continued pick-up in energy prices can get us to a new high” in headline inflation, said Steve Chiavarone, senior portfolio manager at Federated Hermes. That “could very well spook markets as it pushes back any expectation of peak inflation, peak Fed hawkishness and could force the market to contemplate a terminal fed funds rate above 5%. All that would raise the risks of more bond pain, more equity pain, and a greater risk of financial accident.”\n“If you had some levered CTA who had a big buy program set to start around 3,505 and then another levered short who doubled down on the CPI print that could have created this snowball where market just ripped as other levered technical systematic traders piled in,” Max Gokhman, chief investment officer for AlphaTrAI, said. “Or someone just got a fat margin call.

All that would raise the risks of more bond pain, more equity pain, and a greater risk of financial accident.”\nMeanwhile, UK markets remained in turmoil almost two weeks after the government unveiled a plan to drastically cut taxes. The pound surged back above $1.13, buoyed by reports that government officials are working on a U-turn of tax cuts. Gilts also rallied, with the yield on 30-year debt dropping as much as 46 basis points.\nThe yen sank to its lowest level in more than 30 years after the US inflation report, before reversing the move in a whiplash trade that raised market chatter of potential intervention\nElsewhere, oil gained for the first time this week, with crude in New York rising back above $89 a barrel after a US crude report flagged potential bullish drivers, shrugging off inflation data. The International Energy Agency earlier warned production cuts agreed by OPEC+ risked causing oil prices to spike and tipping the global economy into recession. \nMLIV Pulse SurveyWhich major economy will slump into recession first and who will emerge from this turmoil as a relative winner?

    "content": "US stocks turned sharply lower in late trading after comments by the Bank of England chief on removing market support rattled investor sentiment. Benchmark Treasury yields rose and the dollar gained.\nThe S&P 500 slid amid renewed selling in tech shares that sent the Nasdaq 100 down more than 1%. Long-end Treasuries bore the brunt of losses and the pound tumbled after BOE Governor Andrew Bailey urged investors to finish winding up positions that they can’t maintain, saying the central bank will halt intervention in the market as planned at the end of this week.\n“When Andrew Bailey makes a comment that he will stop QE on Friday, this is going to be an interesting test,” Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer at Rockefeller Global Family Office, said on Bloomberg TV. “It’s a very interesting line in the sand. Will the market push back? How much higher will the yields run? We’ll see.”\nRisk sentiment remained fragile after a four-day losing streak wiped $1.6 trillion off the value of the S&P 500 Index ahead of US inflation readings. Data Thursday may seal the case for another 75-basis-point interest-rate increase at the next Federal Reserve meeting in the absence of a major shortfall. \nNor have officials given any inclination to pause their rate-hiking cycle in the near future, with Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester saying Tuesday officials need to keep raising interest rates and cannot get complacent. \nMore market comments:\n“The gilt market is one of the more fragile elements of global finance right now,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “The BOE rescued global markets in the last week of September when they stabilized gilts, so it’s a big risk if they’re going to let them potentially drift lower.”“Tuesday’s price action was heavily reliant on the influence of the gilt market; selling off in sympathy with British yields overnight and stabilizing once London left for the day until governor Bailey’s hawkish remarks drove a partial reversal,” Ian Lyngen and Ben Jeffery at BMO Capital Markets wrote in a note.\n“The gilt market is one of the more fragile elements of global finance right now,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “The BOE rescued global markets in the last week of September when they stabilized gilts, so it’s a big risk if they’re going to let them potentially drift lower.”\n“Tuesday’s price action was heavily reliant on the influence of the gilt market; selling off in sympathy with British yields overnight and stabilizing once London left for the day until governor Bailey’s hawkish remarks drove a partial reversal,” Ian Lyngen and Ben Jeffery at BMO Capital Markets wrote in a note.\nIn addition to inflation data, big US banks kick off the third-quarter earnings season in earnest later this week, with strategists braced for weak profits against a drumbeat of warnings over the rising risk of a global recession. The International Monetary Fund joined the refrain, warning of a worsening outlook as efforts to curb inflation may add to damage from the war in Ukraine and China’s slowdown. \n“We have not seen the impact of tightening,” Michael Kelly, head of the multi-asset team at PineBridge Investments told Bloomberg TV. “That lies ahead and when we see that, it’s another leg down for risk assets.”\nMeanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened further missile attacks on Ukraine after hitting Kyiv and other cities in the most intense barrage of strikes since the first days of its invasion.\n“It’s little wonder investors enter the week in a dreary mood, especially with headlines from Ukraine signaling a further escalation in geopolitical tensions,” Christopher Smart, chief global strategist at Barings, said in a note. \nWith world growth under pressure, US oil futures tumbled more than 2%, giving up more of last week’s 17% rally. \nMLIV Pulse SurveyWhich major economy will slump into recession first and who will emerge from this turmoil as a relative winner?

    "body": "<body>\n <p>\n  Wall Street got a reality check, with data showing a hot labor market that will likely keep the Federal Reserve on its aggressive hiking trail. Those bets sent stocks tumbling and drove 10-year US yields to their longest weekly up streak since 1984.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To David Donabedian at CIBC Private Wealth US, the report puts an “an exclamation point” on the idea that the market-bottoming process is going to be “a long one”. In this “bizarro world” of big hikes, traders may see the solid data as a reason to brace for turmoil, says Callie Cox of eToro. The conclusion for Brown Brothers Harriman’s Win Thin is that a 75-basis-point Fed boost in November is a “done deal,” with another increase of that size in December becoming a “real possibility.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  Almost 95% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 fell. The slide came just a few days after the gauge notched its biggest back-to-back rally since the onset of the pandemic amid a debate on whether the Fed would be closer to “peak hawkishness.” Those gains gave the measure its best week in a month even with the post-jobs plunge. The Nasdaq 100 sank nearly 4% Friday.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ten-year yields approached 3.9% amid their 10th consecutive weekly rise. The dollar advanced. The swap contract for the November Fed meeting priced in nearly 75 basis points of tightening. Market-implied expectations for where the rate will peak also increased, with the derivative contract for the March gathering trading around 4.66%. The current range for the benchmark rate stands between 3% and 3.25%.\n </p>\n <h3>\n  Resolutely Hawkish\n </h3>\n <p>\n  Fed Bank of New York President John Williams said rates need to rise to around 4.5% over time, but the pace and ultimate peak of the tightening campaign will hinge on how the economy performs. Several officials, in separate remarks this week, delivered a resolutely hawkish message that price pressures remain elevated and they won’t be deterred from raising rates by volatility in financial markets.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said it’s important for the Fed to deliver on the further monetary tightening it has signaled, even in the face of financial risks stemming from its actions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All eyes will now be on next week’s US inflation data after a hotter-than-expected reading in August tempered hopes of a nascent slowdown. Separately, minutes from the Fed’s September meeting will give clues into the central bank’s tolerance for economic pain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Amid fears of a looming recession, investors poured the most money into cash since April 2020, but stocks could see further declines as they don’t fully reflect that risk, according to Bank of America Corp. strategists. Their report cited EPFR Global data showing cash funds received nearly $89 billion in the week through Oct. 5 -- while investors withdrew $3.3 billion from global stock funds.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wall Street is “rebelling against” policy tightening, the strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote before the labor-market report.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From a technical perspective, the fact that the S&amp;P 500 remains oversold enough alongside bearish sentiment may warrant “more rally efforts” that could materialize as early as next week, according to Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “The data being reported alongside our proprietary cycle work to date gives us confidence that we are on the right track in anticipating more of a ‘U’-shaped market bottom and recovery in the months ahead (into 2023),” he added. “We believe the floor will be established at some point in the weeks/months ahead -- but for now, investors should continue to expect a very choppy glide path due to significant macro overhang.”\n </p>\n <h3>\n  More comments on jobs:\n </h3>\n <p>\n  Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   “In a word: ‘frustrating.’ As long as job gains are strong, the markets should expect aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.”\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Michael Shaoul, chief executive officer at Marketfield Asset Management:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   “This report should keep expectations of any ‘dovish pivot’ at bay, and underlines our concerns that any shift in policy is much more likely to be provoked by much worse financial market conditions than a soft landing in the underlying US economy.”\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Shawn Cruz, head trading strategist at TD Ameritrade:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   “The market has been in a ‘bad-news-is-good-news’ mentality and there’s really no bad news in this report. It’s a solid jobs report, but it’s not what the market wants to see because it doesn’t give the Fed a reason to pause or shift away from its hawkish intentions.”\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Ronald Temple, managing director at Lazard Asset Management:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   “While job growth is slowing, the US economy remains far too hot for the Fed to achieve its inflation target. The path to a soft landing keeps getting more challenging.

    "content": "Wall Street got a reality check, with data showing a hot labor market that will likely keep the Federal Reserve on its aggressive hiking trail. Those bets sent stocks tumbling and drove 10-year US yields to their longest weekly up streak since 1984.\nTo David Donabedian at CIBC Private Wealth US, the report puts an “an exclamation point” on the idea that the market-bottoming process is going to be “a long one”. In this “bizarro world” of big hikes, traders may see the solid data as a reason to brace for turmoil, says Callie Cox of eToro. The conclusion for Brown Brothers Harriman’s Win Thin is that a 75-basis-point Fed boost in November is a “done deal,” with another increase of that size in December becoming a “real possibility.”\nAlmost 95% of the companies in the S&P 500 fell. The slide came just a few days after the gauge notched its biggest back-to-back rally since the onset of the pandemic amid a debate on whether the Fed would be closer to “peak hawkishness.” Those gains gave the measure its best week in a month even with the post-jobs plunge. The Nasdaq 100 sank nearly 4% Friday.\nTen-year yields approached 3.9% amid their 10th consecutive weekly rise. The dollar advanced. The swap contract for the November Fed meeting priced in nearly 75 basis points of tightening. Market-implied expectations for where the rate will peak also increased, with the derivative contract for the March gathering trading around 4.66%. The current range for the benchmark rate stands between 3% and 3.25%.\nResolutely Hawkish\nFed Bank of New York President John Williams said rates need to rise to around 4.5% over time, but the pace and ultimate peak of the tightening campaign will hinge on how the economy performs. Several officials, in separate remarks this week, delivered a resolutely hawkish message that price pressures remain elevated and they won’t be deterred from raising rates by volatility in financial markets.\nFormer Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said it’s important for the Fed to deliver on the further monetary tightening it has signaled, even in the face of financial risks stemming from its actions.\nAll eyes will now be on next week’s US inflation data after a hotter-than-expected reading in August tempered hopes of a nascent slowdown. Separately, minutes from the Fed’s September meeting will give clues into the central bank’s tolerance for economic pain.\nAmid fears of a looming recession, investors poured the most money into cash since April 2020, but stocks could see further declines as they don’t fully reflect that risk, according to Bank of America Corp. strategists. Their report cited EPFR Global data showing cash funds received nearly $89 billion in the week through Oct. 5 -- while investors withdrew $3.3 billion from global stock funds.\nWall Street is “rebelling against” policy tightening, the strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote before the labor-market report.\nFrom a technical perspective, the fact that the S&P 500 remains oversold enough alongside bearish sentiment may warrant “more rally efforts” that could materialize as early as next week, according to Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott.\n“The data being reported alongside our proprietary cycle work to date gives us confidence that we are on the right track in anticipating more of a ‘U’-shaped market bottom and recovery in the months ahead (into 2023),” he added. “We believe the floor will be established at some point in the weeks/months ahead -- but for now, investors should continue to expect a very choppy glide path due to significant macro overhang.”\nMore comments on jobs:\nJeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial:\n“In a word: ‘frustrating.’ As long as job gains are strong, the markets should expect aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.”\n“In a word: ‘frustrating.’ As long as job gains are strong, the markets should expect aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.”\nMichael Shaoul, chief executive officer at Marketfield Asset Management:\n“This report should keep expectations of any ‘dovish pivot’ at bay, and underlines our concerns that any shift in policy is much more likely to be provoked by much worse financial market conditions than a soft landing in the underlying US economy.”\n“This report should keep expectations of any ‘dovish pivot’ at bay, and underlines our concerns that any shift in policy is much more likely to be provoked by much worse financial market conditions than a soft landing in the underlying US economy.”\nShawn Cruz, head trading strategist at TD Ameritrade:\n“The market has been in a ‘bad-news-is-good-news’ mentality and there’s really no bad news in this report. It’s a solid jobs report, but it’s not what the market wants to see because it doesn’t give the Fed a reason to pause or shift away from its hawkish intentions.”\n“The market has been in a ‘bad-news-is-good-news’ mentality and there’s really no bad news in this report. It’s a solid jobs report, but it’s not what the market wants to see because it doesn’t give the Fed a reason to pause or shift away from its hawkish intentions.”\nRonald Temple, managing director at Lazard Asset Management:\n“While job growth is slowing, the US economy remains far too hot for the Fed to achieve its inflation target. The path to a soft landing keeps getting more challenging. If there are any doves left on the FOMC, today’s report might have further thinned their ranks.”\n“While job growth is slowing, the US economy remains far too hot for the Fed to achieve its inflation target.

    "body": "<body>\n <p>\n  US stocks plunged to the lowest since November 2020 as another group of Federal Reserve officials struck a hawkish tone, and turmoil in Europe continued to fray investor nerves.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The S&amp;P 500 fell as much as 2.9% during Thursday’s session but trimmed losses as markets closed. Its decline wipes out an ill-timed attempt Wednesday to rebound from a six-day slide.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 dropped nearly 4% during the session after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said investors have now understood that they can’t escape additional rate hikes in coming months. The index was dragged down by Apple Inc., which fell as much as 6.1% after a rare analyst downgrade from Bank of America warning of weaker consumer demand for its popular devices.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Signs of stress emerged in the interest-rate swaps market and a leveraged-buyout deal was shelved. US Treasuries pared earlier losses, with the 10-year yield hovering around 3.76%.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In Europe, UK gilt yields rose after Prime Minister Liz Truss’s defense of unfunded tax cuts that sent markets into turmoil failed to persuade investors. German inflation topped 10% and the country agreed to energy caps that could add to inflationary pressures.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Investors are grappling with threats posed by discordant moves from central banks over the past few days, with Fed officials adamant on further monetary tightening, the Bank of England unveiling a plan to support government debt and authorities in Asia trying to prop up weakening currencies.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “I was actually really surprised by the impact that the Bank of England had on the global market,” said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index. “Yet, it was short-lived, the relief rally. We sort of pushed past that quite quickly and it seems to be back to that narrative of inflation fears, higher-interest-rate fears.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fed officials haven’t shied away from warning that more rate-hike pain is yet to come, with Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester echoing the rhetoric that her colleagues reinforced this week. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, after US markets closed, said the central bank should curb inflation in a manner that avoids a difficult downturn.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Better-than-expected 2Q core PCE and personal consumption numbers on Thursday also paved the path for the Fed to stay aggressive.

    "content": "US stocks plunged to the lowest since November 2020 as another group of Federal Reserve officials struck a hawkish tone, and turmoil in Europe continued to fray investor nerves.\nThe S&P 500 fell as much as 2.9% during Thursday’s session but trimmed losses as markets closed. Its decline wipes out an ill-timed attempt Wednesday to rebound from a six-day slide. \nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 dropped nearly 4% during the session after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said investors have now understood that they can’t escape additional rate hikes in coming months. The index was dragged down by Apple Inc., which fell as much as 6.1% after a rare analyst downgrade from Bank of America warning of weaker consumer demand for its popular devices.\nSigns of stress emerged in the interest-rate swaps market and a leveraged-buyout deal was shelved. US Treasuries pared earlier losses, with the 10-year yield hovering around 3.76%.\nIn Europe, UK gilt yields rose after Prime Minister Liz Truss’s defense of unfunded tax cuts that sent markets into turmoil failed to persuade investors. German inflation topped 10% and the country agreed to energy caps that could add to inflationary pressures.\nInvestors are grappling with threats posed by discordant moves from central banks over the past few days, with Fed officials adamant on further monetary tightening, the Bank of England unveiling a plan to support government debt and authorities in Asia trying to prop up weakening currencies.\n“I was actually really surprised by the impact that the Bank of England had on the global market,” said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index. “Yet, it was short-lived, the relief rally. We sort of pushed past that quite quickly and it seems to be back to that narrative of inflation fears, higher-interest-rate fears.”\nFed officials haven’t shied away from warning that more rate-hike pain is yet to come, with Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester echoing the rhetoric that her colleagues reinforced this week. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, after US markets closed, said the central bank should curb inflation in a manner that avoids a difficult downturn. \nBetter-than-expected 2Q core PCE and personal consumption numbers on Thursday also paved the path for the Fed to stay aggressive. Weekly jobless claims fell to the lowest since April, showing a persistently tight labor market.\nRecession concerns persisted as a gap in the government’s two primary measures of US economic activity during the first half of 2022 narrowed. The National Bureau of Economic Research’s Business Cycle Dating Committee uses this metric and other variables to make any recession call.\n“The market is now coming to terms with the idea that a recession is almost a given at this point and it’s really making adjustments for that,” said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi US Wealth Management. \nSeparately, the European Commission announced an eighth package of sanctions that would include a price cap on Russia’s oil exports as Russia vowed to go ahead with the annexation of the parts of Ukraine that its troops currently control after UN-condemned votes, putting the Kremlin on a fresh collision course with the US and its allies.\nHow much damage is a strong dollar causing?

    "body": "<body>\n <p>\n  US stocks fell in a volatile session exacerbated by sharp moves in the UK currency and bond markets, as hawkish central banks across the globe continued to subdue sentiment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The S&amp;P 500 ended Monday’s session at its lowest level since December 2020. The Cboe Volatility Index spiked past 30, a level it hasn’t closed above since June. US Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year rate climbing as much as 21 basis points to 3.898%, its highest level since April 2010.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index, a key gauge for raw materials prices, tumbled to the lowest in eight months as fears of a global recession intensified. The pound dropped after the Bank of England said it may not act before November to stem a rout that took the sterling to a record low. The dollar soared to yet another record high.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Markets are on the edge after a selloff of risk assets deepened last week as the UK’s plan to lift its economy fueled fears that heightened inflation would push rates higher and ignite a global recession. UK markets were in focus on Monday as the pound remained volatile after crashing to an all-time low, with the Bank of England’s comments doing little to reassure traders who were waiting for a broader policy response to the fallout from the government’s massive tax cuts.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Federal Reserve officials added to the hawkish rhetoric. On Monday, Boston Fed President Susan Collins said additional tightening is needed to rein in stubbornly high inflation and cautioned the process will require some job losses. Her Cleveland counterpart Loretta Mester echoed this. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic also said the central bank still has a ways to go to control inflation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “On the macro front, it feels like a remake of West Side Story, with a gang of central bankers going after the job market, which refuses to let go,” said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners. “Powell and now Andrew Bailey at the BOE are trying to slow the economy down, but my sense is employers are keeping as many workers as they can to avoid being left out in the cold when we recover from the next recession. So we almost have an arms race with central bankers raising rates and employers holding on to workers.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  US markets will continue to remain challenged by uncertainty until companies start to report their third-quarter earnings next month, which will provide greater detail on the health of corporate revenues and profit, wrote John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer. Any company or industry that needs lower rates could be in trouble, FBB’s Bailey says.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Investors will also be keeping an eye on the economic data stream for hints of prices cooling, Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley, wrote in a note.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “What the market will need to see now to get out of the current conundrum is for inflation inputs to start coming down noticeably,” said Hogan. “We will get a read on the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator this Thursday when the second quarter core PCE is reported. Along with that investors will keep a close eye on the economic data stream for hints of prices paid coming down.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  Trading this week will be punctuated by a number of economic reports including US initial jobless claims and gross-domestic-product data, along with PMI figures from China. Choppiness in price moves is likely with a steady stream of Federal Reserve officials speaking through the week.\n </p>\n <h3>\n  UK Gilts\n </h3>\n <p>\n  The plunge in UK gilts sent 10-year yields above 4% for the first time since 2010. Traders ramped up wagers on the scale of interest-rate hikes in the short term, with money markets pricing in more than 200 basis points of increases by the central bank’s next meeting in November.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Meanwhile, Christine Lagarde said the European Central Bank will consider shrinking its balance sheet only once it has completed the “normalization” of interest rates.

    "content": "US stocks fell in a volatile session exacerbated by sharp moves in the UK currency and bond markets, as hawkish central banks across the globe continued to subdue sentiment. \nThe S&P 500 ended Monday’s session at its lowest level since December 2020. The Cboe Volatility Index spiked past 30, a level it hasn’t closed above since June. US Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year rate climbing as much as 21 basis points to 3.898%, its highest level since April 2010. \nThe Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index, a key gauge for raw materials prices, tumbled to the lowest in eight months as fears of a global recession intensified. The pound dropped after the Bank of England said it may not act before November to stem a rout that took the sterling to a record low. The dollar soared to yet another record high.\nMarkets are on the edge after a selloff of risk assets deepened last week as the UK’s plan to lift its economy fueled fears that heightened inflation would push rates higher and ignite a global recession. UK markets were in focus on Monday as the pound remained volatile after crashing to an all-time low, with the Bank of England’s comments doing little to reassure traders who were waiting for a broader policy response to the fallout from the government’s massive tax cuts.\nFederal Reserve officials added to the hawkish rhetoric. On Monday, Boston Fed President Susan Collins said additional tightening is needed to rein in stubbornly high inflation and cautioned the process will require some job losses. Her Cleveland counterpart Loretta Mester echoed this. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic also said the central bank still has a ways to go to control inflation. \n“On the macro front, it feels like a remake of West Side Story, with a gang of central bankers going after the job market, which refuses to let go,” said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners. “Powell and now Andrew Bailey at the BOE are trying to slow the economy down, but my sense is employers are keeping as many workers as they can to avoid being left out in the cold when we recover from the next recession. So we almost have an arms race with central bankers raising rates and employers holding on to workers.”\nUS markets will continue to remain challenged by uncertainty until companies start to report their third-quarter earnings next month, which will provide greater detail on the health of corporate revenues and profit, wrote John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer. Any company or industry that needs lower rates could be in trouble, FBB’s Bailey says. \nInvestors will also be keeping an eye on the economic data stream for hints of prices cooling, Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley, wrote in a note. \n“What the market will need to see now to get out of the current conundrum is for inflation inputs to start coming down noticeably,” said Hogan. “We will get a read on the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator this Thursday when the second quarter core PCE is reported. Along with that investors will keep a close eye on the economic data stream for hints of prices paid coming down.”\nTrading this week will be punctuated by a number of economic reports including US initial jobless claims and gross-domestic-product data, along with PMI figures from China. Choppiness in price moves is likely with a steady stream of Federal Reserve officials speaking through the week.\nUK Gilts\nThe plunge in UK gilts sent 10-year yields above 4% for the first time since 2010. Traders ramped up wagers on the scale of interest-rate hikes in the short term, with money markets pricing in more than 200 basis points of increases by the central bank’s next meeting in November. \nMeanwhile, Christine Lagarde said the European Central Bank will consider shrinking its balance sheet only once it has completed the “normalization” of interest rates. Raising borrowing costs is the most appropriate and effective tool for now to combat record-high euro-area inflation, the ECB President said on Monday. \nGeopolitical risks from the war in Ukraine to escalating tensions over Taiwan and unrest in Iran also continue to weigh on market sentiment. The OECD cut almost all growth forecasts for the Group of 20 next year while anticipating further interest-rate hikes. And a gauge of German business confidence deteriorated. \nKey events this week:\nChina industrial profits, TuesdayUS new home sales, Conference Board consumer confidence, durable goods, TuesdayFed Chair Jerome Powell and Charles Evans speak at events, TuesdayFed’s Mary Daly, Rafael Bostic, Charles Evans and ECB President Christine Lagarde speak at events, WednesdayEuro zone economic confidence, consumer confidence, Germany CPI, ThursdayUS initial jobless claims, GDP, ThursdayFed’s Loretta Mester, Mary Daly speak at events, ThursdayChina PMI, FridayEuro zone CPI, unemployment, FridayUS consumer income , University of Michigan consumer sentiment, FridayFed’s Lael Brainard and John Williams speak, Friday\nChina industrial profits, Tuesday\nUS new home sales, Conference Board consumer confidence, durable goods, Tuesday\nFed Chair Jerome Powell and Charles Evans speak at events, Tuesday\nFed’s Mary Daly, Rafael Bostic, Charles Evans and ECB President Christine Lagarde speak at events, Wednesday\nEuro zone economic confidence, consumer confidence, Germany CPI, Thursday\nUS initial jobless claims, GDP, Thursday\nFed’s Loretta Mester, Mary Daly speak at events, Thursday\nChina PMI, Friday\nEuro zone CPI, unemployment, Friday\nUS consumer income , University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Friday\nFed’s Lael Brainard and John Williams speak, Friday\nSome of the main moves in markets:\nStocks\nThe S&P 500 fell 1% as of 4:03 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 fell 0.5%The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1%The MSCI World index fell 2%\nThe S&P 500 fell 1% as of 4:03 p.m. New York time\nThe Nasdaq 100 fell 0.5%\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1%\nThe MSCI World index fell 2%\nCurrencies\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 1%The euro fell 0.7% to $0.9617The British pound fell 1.5% to $1.0697The Japanese yen fell 0.9% to 144.56 per dollar\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 1%\nThe euro fell 0.7% to $0.9617\nThe British pound fell 1.5% to $1.0697\nThe Japanese yen fell 0.9% to 144.56 per dollar\nCryptocurrencies\nBitcoin rose 1.4% to $19,173.2Ether rose 2.9% to $1,329.58\nBitcoin rose 1.4% to $19,173.2\nEther rose 2.9% to $1,329.58\nBonds\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced 21 basis points to 3.89%Germany’s 10-year yield advanced nine basis points to 2.11%Britain’s 10-year yield advanced 42 basis points to 4.24%\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced 21 basis points to 3.89%\nGermany’s 10-year yield advanced nine basis points to 2.11%\nBritain’s 10-year yield advanced 42 basis points to 4.24%\nCommodities\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 2.3% to $76.92 a barrelGold futures fell 1.3% to $1,633.60 an ounce\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 2.3% to $76.92 a barrel\nGold futures fell 1.3% to $1,633.60 an ounce\n",

    "body": "<body>\n <p>\n  Stocks came under pressure as Treasury yields hit multiyear highs, with traders bracing for a hawkish Federal Reserve that’s expected to boost rates to levels not seen since before the 2008 financial crisis.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A slide in equities pushed the S&amp;P 500 more than 10% below its Aug. 16 high -- which marked the peak of rally from the June bottom. About 93% of its companies were down Tuesday, with all major groups in the red. Ford Motor Co. tumbled the most in 11 years after warning on inflation costs. Two-year US yields approached 4% while a dollar gauge rose to a record.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fed officials are about to put numbers on the “pain” they’ve been warning of when they publish new economic projections Wednesday. They could show a substantial rise in rates and unemployment ahead as the estimated price tag for reducing inflation. Officials are expected to hike by 75 basis points again -- and a few market observers say a full-point move might also be on the table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To Charlie McElligott, cross-asset strategist at Nomura Securities International, the market is underpricing the possibility that the Fed could opt for a bigger move of 100 basis points.

    "body": "<body>\n <p>\n  Stocks fluctuated as investors weighed the prospect of large interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Treasury yields and the dollar edged higher.\n </p>\n <p>\n  European stocks and US futures were little changed after the S&amp;P 500 closed in the green thanks to dip buyers late in the session. Banks outperformed, while utilities slumped. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index reversed earlier gains as China dragged the region lower.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Traders remain focused on US economic data, with a decline in producer prices there providing some relief after the jolt from consumer-price figures saw wagers for rate increases ratchet higher. Retail sales due Thursday and University of Michigan readings Friday will be parsed for clues on the strength of the economy and inflation expectations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “I think you want to begin to add risk back into your portfolio,” Nancy Tengler, chief executive and chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments said on Bloomberg TV. “I do think, despite the CPI number we got the day before yesterday, we are approaching or at peak inflation, and historically it has always been appropriate and good for your portfolio if you added to equities when we hit peak inflation.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  Swaps traders are pricing in a 75 basis point hike when the Fed meets next week, with some wagers appearing for a full-point move. The continued rise in rate-sensitive Treasuries deepened the curve inversion -- a harbinger for a looming recession -- to a level unseen this century.\n </p>\n <p>\n  While the magnitude of the stock rout was impressive following hot US inflation data, the S&amp;P 500 only reversed most of the gains made in the previous four sessions. The lack of a surge in the VIX index -- known as the “fear gauge” -- suggests that the selloff was a recalibration of those expectations rather than panic selling.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Asian currencies remained at risk from a strong greenback. The yen weakened on Thursday to trade around 143.75 per dollar after it rallied away from just under the closely-watched 145 level Wednesday on signs the Bank of Japan was preparing an intervention.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Crude oil fluctuated amid optimism for demand, with China easing Covid restrictions in the megacity of Chengdu. Natural gas increased again as traders weighed if Europe’s steps to contain the energy crisis will be enough to curb costs of the fuel after a price cap proposal was ditched for lack of consensus.

    "content": "Stocks fluctuated as investors weighed the prospect of large interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Treasury yields and the dollar edged higher. \nEuropean stocks and US futures were little changed after the S&P 500 closed in the green thanks to dip buyers late in the session. Banks outperformed, while utilities slumped. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index reversed earlier gains as China dragged the region lower.\nTraders remain focused on US economic data, with a decline in producer prices there providing some relief after the jolt from consumer-price figures saw wagers for rate increases ratchet higher. Retail sales due Thursday and University of Michigan readings Friday will be parsed for clues on the strength of the economy and inflation expectations.  \n“I think you want to begin to add risk back into your portfolio,” Nancy Tengler, chief executive and chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments said on Bloomberg TV. “I do think, despite the CPI number we got the day before yesterday, we are approaching or at peak inflation, and historically it has always been appropriate and good for your portfolio if you added to equities when we hit peak inflation.”\nSwaps traders are pricing in a 75 basis point hike when the Fed meets next week, with some wagers appearing for a full-point move. The continued rise in rate-sensitive Treasuries deepened the curve inversion -- a harbinger for a looming recession -- to a level unseen this century. \nWhile the magnitude of the stock rout was impressive following hot US inflation data, the S&P 500 only reversed most of the gains made in the previous four sessions. The lack of a surge in the VIX index -- known as the “fear gauge” -- suggests that the selloff was a recalibration of those expectations rather than panic selling. \nAsian currencies remained at risk from a strong greenback. The yen weakened on Thursday to trade around 143.75 per dollar after it rallied away from just under the closely-watched 145 level Wednesday on signs the Bank of Japan was preparing an intervention. \nCrude oil fluctuated amid optimism for demand, with China easing Covid restrictions in the megacity of Chengdu. Natural gas increased again as traders weighed if Europe’s steps to contain the energy crisis will be enough to curb costs of the fuel after a price cap proposal was ditched for lack of consensus.

    "body": "<body>\n <p>\n  A broad-based selloff sent equities to their worst day in more than two years after hotter-than-expected inflation data fueled bets on a jumbo hike by the Federal Reserve next week. Treasury yields surged and the dollar gained.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Across the board selling sent the S&amp;P 500 down more than 4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 losses surpassed 5% as yield-sensitive stocks took the biggest hit. Both benchmarks suffered their worst one-day routs since 2020. Swaps traders are now fully pricing in a rate increase of three-quarters of a percentage point, with wagers rising for a similar move in November and policy rates ultimately reaching around 4.3% early in 2023.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Read more: ‘They Should Do 100’: Traders Debate the Fed’s Next Rate Move\n </p>\n <p>\n  The two-year Treasury yield, the most sensitive to policy changes, jumped as much as 22 basis points, pushing it more than 30 basis points above the 10-year rate and deepening an inversion in what is generally a recession warning.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The consumer price index increased 0.1% from July, after no change in the prior month, Labor Department data showed Tuesday. From a year earlier, prices climbed 8.3%, a slight deceleration but still more than the median estimate of 8.1%. So-called core CPI, which strips out the more volatile food and energy components,  also topped forecasts.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Read more: Biggest Jump in US Rents Since 1991 Keeps Overall Inflation High\n </p>\n <p>\n  “Overall, today was a surprising day against the trend of what had appeared to be some moderation across most indicators of growth and pricing pressure, so the Fed’s job is clearly not finished,” Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock Inc., the world’s biggest asset manager, wrote. “We think the Fed will pause the rate hiking cycle potentially at year-end, but maybe now the central bank will have to wait a bit longer to do that after having reached a restrictive policy stance.”\n </p>\n <h3>\n  More comments\n </h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   “Headline inflation has peaked but, in a clear sign that the need to continue hiking rates is undiminished, core CPI is once again on the rise, confirming the very sticky nature of the US inflation problem,” Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors, said in a note. “In fact, 70% of the CPI basket is seeing an annualized price rise of more than 4% month-on-month. Until the Fed can tame that beast, there is simply no room for a discussion on pivots or pauses.”\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   “The CPI report was an unequivocal negative for equity markets,” wrote Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors. “The hotter than expected report means we will get continued pressure from Fed policy via rate hikes.

    "content": "A broad-based selloff sent equities to their worst day in more than two years after hotter-than-expected inflation data fueled bets on a jumbo hike by the Federal Reserve next week. Treasury yields surged and the dollar gained.\nAcross the board selling sent the S&P 500 down more than 4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 losses surpassed 5% as yield-sensitive stocks took the biggest hit. Both benchmarks suffered their worst one-day routs since 2020. Swaps traders are now fully pricing in a rate increase of three-quarters of a percentage point, with wagers rising for a similar move in November and policy rates ultimately reaching around 4.3% early in 2023.\nRead more: ‘They Should Do 100’: Traders Debate the Fed’s Next Rate Move\nThe two-year Treasury yield, the most sensitive to policy changes, jumped as much as 22 basis points, pushing it more than 30 basis points above the 10-year rate and deepening an inversion in what is generally a recession warning.\nThe consumer price index increased 0.1% from July, after no change in the prior month, Labor Department data showed Tuesday. From a year earlier, prices climbed 8.3%, a slight deceleration but still more than the median estimate of 8.1%. So-called core CPI, which strips out the more volatile food and energy components,  also topped forecasts. \nRead more: Biggest Jump in US Rents Since 1991 Keeps Overall Inflation High\n“Overall, today was a surprising day against the trend of what had appeared to be some moderation across most indicators of growth and pricing pressure, so the Fed’s job is clearly not finished,” Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock Inc., the world’s biggest asset manager, wrote. “We think the Fed will pause the rate hiking cycle potentially at year-end, but maybe now the central bank will have to wait a bit longer to do that after having reached a restrictive policy stance.”\nMore comments\n“Headline inflation has peaked but, in a clear sign that the need to continue hiking rates is undiminished, core CPI is once again on the rise, confirming the very sticky nature of the US inflation problem,” Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors, said in a note. “In fact, 70% of the CPI basket is seeing an annualized price rise of more than 4% month-on-month. Until the Fed can tame that beast, there is simply no room for a discussion on pivots or pauses.”“The CPI report was an unequivocal negative for equity markets,” wrote Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors. “The hotter than expected report means we will get continued pressure from Fed policy via rate hikes.

    "body": "<body>\n <p>\n  Stocks joined gains in riskier corners of the market, with the dollar slumping after a seemingly unstoppable surge that rattled global currencies and stoked fears of more headwinds for Corporate America.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In a bullish signal, the S&amp;P 500 topped its 100-day average, snapping a three-week losing streak. The Nasdaq 100 outperformed. Profitless tech firms, meme shares and Bitcoin all rallied. The greenback pushed away from a record high, challenging skeptics who dubbed the drop a correction as calls for a stronger currency were still in place amid tighter Federal Reserve policy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Investors defied hawkish Fed remarks and recession worries after a rout that drove equities to nearly oversold levels. Citigroup Inc. said the mood was so pessimistic it would indicate a rebound is afoot if there weren’t so many risks ahead. The Levkovich Index, a sentiment gauge, fell to -16 this week, a hair away from the -17 level that defines panic. Bank of America Corp.’s bull-and-bear indicator slid to the “maximum bearish” level -- often seen as a contrarian buy signal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “The tug of war between the bull and bear case for markets boils down to the ability of the Fed to tamp down inflation without crushing economic growth, and how much tightening of monetary policy has been effectively priced in,” wrote Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Traders almost fully expected another jumbo-sized hike in September, following two 75-basis-point increases. Fed Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said he was leaning “more strongly” toward a third straight boost of that magnitude. His Kansas City counterpart Esther George noted officials have a “clear-cut” case for continuing to remove monetary support. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he favors “another significant” increase in rates.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To David Donabedian at CIBC Private Wealth US, this week’s market recovery has shown there is continued resilience in the economy. But he also pointed out that a sustainable bull market would hinge upon three factors falling into place: a belief that the Fed is about done with tightening, a convincing inflation downward trend and more realistic expectations for corporate earnings.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Read: Forced Buying Puts a Floor Under Stocks Nobody Else Wants to Own\n </p>\n <p>\n  “Despite the idea that the Fed will kill the economy, we have not seen any signs of that,” said Donabedian. “We have not reached the bottom of the bear-market yet.

    "content": "Stocks joined gains in riskier corners of the market, with the dollar slumping after a seemingly unstoppable surge that rattled global currencies and stoked fears of more headwinds for Corporate America.\nIn a bullish signal, the S&P 500 topped its 100-day average, snapping a three-week losing streak. The Nasdaq 100 outperformed. Profitless tech firms, meme shares and Bitcoin all rallied. The greenback pushed away from a record high, challenging skeptics who dubbed the drop a correction as calls for a stronger currency were still in place amid tighter Federal Reserve policy.\nInvestors defied hawkish Fed remarks and recession worries after a rout that drove equities to nearly oversold levels. Citigroup Inc. said the mood was so pessimistic it would indicate a rebound is afoot if there weren’t so many risks ahead. The Levkovich Index, a sentiment gauge, fell to -16 this week, a hair away from the -17 level that defines panic. Bank of America Corp.’s bull-and-bear indicator slid to the “maximum bearish” level -- often seen as a contrarian buy signal.\n“The tug of war between the bull and bear case for markets boils down to the ability of the Fed to tamp down inflation without crushing economic growth, and how much tightening of monetary policy has been effectively priced in,” wrote Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley.\nTraders almost fully expected another jumbo-sized hike in September, following two 75-basis-point increases. Fed Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said he was leaning “more strongly” toward a third straight boost of that magnitude. His Kansas City counterpart Esther George noted officials have a “clear-cut” case for continuing to remove monetary support. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he favors “another significant” increase in rates.\nTo David Donabedian at CIBC Private Wealth US, this week’s market recovery has shown there is continued resilience in the economy. But he also pointed out that a sustainable bull market would hinge upon three factors falling into place: a belief that the Fed is about done with tightening, a convincing inflation downward trend and more realistic expectations for corporate earnings.\nRead: Forced Buying Puts a Floor Under Stocks Nobody Else Wants to Own \n“Despite the idea that the Fed will kill the economy, we have not seen any signs of that,” said Donabedian. “We have not reached the bottom of the bear-market yet. Indeed, the journey to the next bull market will take time, and will be marked by a series of setbacks and recoveries.”\nIn fact, data show that investors might still be more likely to sell the dip than buy it.

    "body": "<body>\n <p>\n  Stocks climbed the most in about a month as Treasury yields halted a surge to multiyear highs, with traders sifting through remarks from a slew of Federal Reserve speakers. Oil plunged, easing concern about price pressures that could imperil the central bank’s war against inflation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  About 95% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 moved higher, with every group but energy ending in the green. Only four of the Nasdaq 100’s members fell as a rally in the tech-heavy gauge topped 2%. Apple Inc. rose after unveiling a new lineup of devices with few surprises beyond one major one: It didn’t raise its US prices during one of the worst years for inflation in decades.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Read: Chart Border Is Graveyard for Shorts in Big Stock and Bond Rally\n </p>\n <p>\n  “Stocks are rebounding as the global bond market selloff takes a break,” wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “Economic momentum remains for the US economy, and that could only improve if inflation continues to soften. Investors seem poised to enter a holding pattern until the September 13th inflation report.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  Oil benchmarks took a hit as demand concerns emanating from China prompted a wave of selling as prices breached technical warning levels. West Texas Intermediate settled below $82 a barrel while Brent closed at $88. The dollar fell after a rally that rattled currencies around the globe and briefly drove gold below the “danger zone” of $1,700 per ounce.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the final week before officials enter a blackout period ahead of the Sept. 20-21 policy meeting, Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard said the US will have to raise interest rates to restrictive levels, while cautioning risks would become more two-sided in the future. She also sees the scope for lower retail margins to ease price pressures.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Separately, Fed Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester warned against declaring early victory on inflation, while her Boston counterpart Susan Collins said it’s too soon to specify what policy makers should do at this month’s gathering. Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr said that inflation is “far too high” and central bankers are committed to restoring price stability.\n </p>\n <p>\n  High prices and a tight labor market weighed on US economic prospects over the next year, though inflation showed signs of decelerating, the Fed said in its Beige Book.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Equities have tumbled since mid-August amid a panoply of risks spanning from restrictive central banks, Europe’s energy crisis and China’s economic slowdown. The recent slide in the S&amp;P 500 pared a bounce from June lows that a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. team led by Peter Oppenheimer described as a “bear-market rally.” The strategists “expect further weakness and bumpy markets before a decisive trough is established.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  Read: Burry of ‘Big Short’ Fame Says ‘No, We Have Not Hit Bottom Yet’\n </p>\n <p>\n  American stocks haven’t fallen enough to account for the elevated inflation pressures that will drive the Fed to keep interest rates high for a sustained period of time, said billionaire investor Thomas Peterffy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The founder and chairman of Interactive Brokers Group Inc. told Bloomberg Television the S&amp;P 500 won’t hit a bottom until it trades at levels between 3,300 and 3,500. After it reaches that trough, it will stay there for “a while” until the US contends with an inflation-fueled economy. The gauge closed at 3,979.87 Wednesday.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “Economies all around the world are slowing down, and that’s really not a market that says we’re on the verge of a dynamic rebound in equities,” Margaret Patel, senior portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments, told Bloomberg Television. “Earnings are going to decelerate a lot. That says a lot of stocks could go down.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bank of America Corp. clients were net sellers of US equities for a third straight week.

    "content": "Stocks climbed the most in about a month as Treasury yields halted a surge to multiyear highs, with traders sifting through remarks from a slew of Federal Reserve speakers. Oil plunged, easing concern about price pressures that could imperil the central bank’s war against inflation.\nAbout 95% of the companies in the S&P 500 moved higher, with every group but energy ending in the green. Only four of the Nasdaq 100’s members fell as a rally in the tech-heavy gauge topped 2%. Apple Inc. rose after unveiling a new lineup of devices with few surprises beyond one major one: It didn’t raise its US prices during one of the worst years for inflation in decades.\nRead: Chart Border Is Graveyard for Shorts in Big Stock and Bond Rally\n“Stocks are rebounding as the global bond market selloff takes a break,” wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “Economic momentum remains for the US economy, and that could only improve if inflation continues to soften. Investors seem poised to enter a holding pattern until the September 13th inflation report.”\nOil benchmarks took a hit as demand concerns emanating from China prompted a wave of selling as prices breached technical warning levels. West Texas Intermediate settled below $82 a barrel while Brent closed at $88. The dollar fell after a rally that rattled currencies around the globe and briefly drove gold below the “danger zone” of $1,700 per ounce.\nIn the final week before officials enter a blackout period ahead of the Sept. 20-21 policy meeting, Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard said the US will have to raise interest rates to restrictive levels, while cautioning risks would become more two-sided in the future. She also sees the scope for lower retail margins to ease price pressures.\nSeparately, Fed Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester warned against declaring early victory on inflation, while her Boston counterpart Susan Collins said it’s too soon to specify what policy makers should do at this month’s gathering. Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr said that inflation is “far too high” and central bankers are committed to restoring price stability.\nHigh prices and a tight labor market weighed on US economic prospects over the next year, though inflation showed signs of decelerating, the Fed said in its Beige Book.\nEquities have tumbled since mid-August amid a panoply of risks spanning from restrictive central banks, Europe’s energy crisis and China’s economic slowdown. The recent slide in the S&P 500 pared a bounce from June lows that a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. team led by Peter Oppenheimer described as a “bear-market rally.” The strategists “expect further weakness and bumpy markets before a decisive trough is established.”\nRead: Burry of ‘Big Short’ Fame Says ‘No, We Have Not Hit Bottom Yet’\nAmerican stocks haven’t fallen enough to account for the elevated inflation pressures that will drive the Fed to keep interest rates high for a sustained period of time, said billionaire investor Thomas Peterffy.\nThe founder and chairman of Interactive Brokers Group Inc. told Bloomberg Television the S&P 500 won’t hit a bottom until it trades at levels between 3,300 and 3,500. After it reaches that trough, it will stay there for “a while” until the US contends with an inflation-fueled economy. The gauge closed at 3,979.87 Wednesday.\n“Economies all around the world are slowing down, and that’s really not a market that says we’re on the verge of a dynamic rebound in equities,” Margaret Patel, senior portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments, told Bloomberg Television. “Earnings are going to decelerate a lot. That says a lot of stocks could go down.”\nBank of America Corp. clients were net sellers of US equities for a third straight week. As the S&P 500 posted weekly losses of over 3%, the group sold $1.9 billion in equities, including exchange-traded funds and single stocks, strategists led by Jill Carey Hall wrote. \nThe weakening economy should favor continued outperformance for cheaper, so-called value stocks over their growth equivalents, a separate Goldman note from strategists led by Cormac Conners said.\n“History shows value stocks outperform around the start of recessions,” they wrote.\nWhat to watch this week:\nEuropean Central Bank rate decision, ThursdayFed Chair Jerome Powell due to speak, ThursdayChicago Fed President Charles Evans and his Minneapolis counterpart Neel Kashkari due to speak, ThursdayEU energy ministers extraordinary meeting on emergency intervention in electricity markets, Friday\nEuropean Central Bank rate decision, Thursday\nFed Chair Jerome Powell due to speak, Thursday\nChicago Fed President Charles Evans and his Minneapolis counterpart Neel Kashkari due to speak, Thursday\nEU energy ministers extraordinary meeting on emergency intervention in electricity markets, Friday\nAre you bullish on energy-related assets?

The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose to another record, while the Japanese yen hit a fresh 24-year low.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “We continue to advise against big market direction calls,” said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management. “Investors should keep their asset allocations closer to their long-term strategic benchmarks.

    "body": "<body>\n <p>\n  European stocks slumped and the euro fell Monday as the region’s worsening energy crisis added to risks for a global economy already facing high inflation and a wave of monetary tightening.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped after Russia’s Gazprom PJSC halted its key gas pipeline indefinitely, although the benchmark gauge recovered from its worst levels as energy stocks rallied. Wall Street equity futures edged higher after the worst week for world shares since June. Cash Treasuries and US stocks are closed because of Labor Day.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The euro retreated to a two-decade low, while the dollar strengthened. The pound was steady after the UK’s Conservative Party named Liz Truss as its leader, clearing her way to become prime minister. Her plan to “turbo-charge” the economy by slashing taxes is already worrying investors amid double-digit inflation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Oil gained as OPEC+ unexpectedly agreed to make a token oil supply cut for October. Elsewhere, Bitcoin dropped below the $20,000 level. Gold was little changed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gazprom announced its move after Group of Seven leaders agreed to implement a price cap on Russian oil as the Kremlin continues its war in Ukraine. Natural gas surged more than 30% in Europe and nations there could roll out special steps at the end of the week to rein in power costs. Germany plans a $65 billion package to shield consumers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “Economies have been preparing for some sort of energy constraint and the prospect of rationing, but obviously compared to expectations at the beginning of the year, this is pretty close to the worst outcome,” Wei Li, BlackRock global chief investment strategist, said on Bloomberg Television. “So as we head into rest of the year, underweight equities at this juncture feels appropriate.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  Monetary authorities including Europe’s central bank are set to keep hiking interest rates this week to fight inflation despite the darkening global economic outlook due to risks such as power shortages.

    "content": "European stocks slumped and the euro fell Monday as the region’s worsening energy crisis added to risks for a global economy already facing high inflation and a wave of monetary tightening.\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped after Russia’s Gazprom PJSC halted its key gas pipeline indefinitely, although the benchmark gauge recovered from its worst levels as energy stocks rallied. Wall Street equity futures edged higher after the worst week for world shares since June. Cash Treasuries and US stocks are closed because of Labor Day.\nThe euro retreated to a two-decade low, while the dollar strengthened. The pound was steady after the UK’s Conservative Party named Liz Truss as its leader, clearing her way to become prime minister. Her plan to “turbo-charge” the economy by slashing taxes is already worrying investors amid double-digit inflation. \nOil gained as OPEC+ unexpectedly agreed to make a token oil supply cut for October. Elsewhere, Bitcoin dropped below the $20,000 level. Gold was little changed.\nGazprom announced its move after Group of Seven leaders agreed to implement a price cap on Russian oil as the Kremlin continues its war in Ukraine. Natural gas surged more than 30% in Europe and nations there could roll out special steps at the end of the week to rein in power costs. Germany plans a $65 billion package to shield consumers.\n“Economies have been preparing for some sort of energy constraint and the prospect of rationing, but obviously compared to expectations at the beginning of the year, this is pretty close to the worst outcome,” Wei Li, BlackRock global chief investment strategist, said on Bloomberg Television. “So as we head into rest of the year, underweight equities at this juncture feels appropriate.”\nMonetary authorities including Europe’s central bank are set to keep hiking interest rates this week to fight inflation despite the darkening global economic outlook due to risks such as power shortages. The escalating energy crisis comes ahead of unprecedented tightening expected from the European Central Bank on Thursday in the form of a 75-basis-point rate increase.\nAn Asian equity index declined, paced by losses in Hong Kong, where tech shares slid as traders weighed the risk of curbs on investment from the US.

The index also ended Friday lower, erasing the gains it notched earlier in the session after the jobs report showed some signs of easing in a still-tight American labor market. A delay in the opening of a key gas pipeline to Europe bruised sentiment in the afternoon, ahead of a three-day weekend for American markets.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Treasuries rallied on Friday, led by short maturities. The policy-sensitive two-year yield ended the week nearly where it began, after topping 3.5% earlier.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The labor-market data on Friday add to a bevy of reports this week that validate the Fed’s assertion that the economy is robust enough to withstand more tightening. Risk assets have been under pressure since Fed Chair Jerome Powell made clear the central bank will raise rates further and keep them elevated until price gains slow.

The news moves the region a step closer to blackouts, rationing and a severe recession.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Investors are already concerned about the European Central Bank possibly raising rates by three-quarters of a percentage point next week.

    "body": "<body>\n <p>\n  Stocks rallied and bond yields fell, with traders awaiting Jerome Powell’s keynote for clues on how much further the Federal Reserve will pump the brakes on the economy to bring inflation back under control.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The S&amp;P 500 closed near session highs, trimming a selloff that knocked down the market earlier in the week. Following the slowest trading day of 2022 for US equities, volume was once again below average. Megacaps like Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. jumped, though Tesla Inc. whipsawed as its stock split took effect. Treasury 10-year rates traded near 3%, while the dollar slipped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Investors were mostly unfazed by hawkish comments from Fed officials gathering for the annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Powell’s speech at 10 a.m. Washington time Friday will mark the highlight of an event that’s been used for making key announcements. The Fed’s boss is widely expected to restate his resolve to keep tightening policy to fight inflationary spirals.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “We are not convinced Jackson Hole tomorrow will be a negative market shock because expectations are hawkish while exposure still low,” said Dennis DeBusschere, founder of 22V Research. “We thought the market correction would be leading into Jackson Hole, and that has largely played out. We are neutral short term.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  Read: Fed Officials Push for More Hikes; Bullard Favors Front-Loading\n </p>\n <p>\n  Traders will also be watching out for any signals about the pace of the Fed’s balance-sheet runoff -- known as quantitative tightening -- which gets up to full speed in September at a monthly clip of up to $95 billion. While some strategists are convinced the unwinding could pose a threat to equities, others say there’s still plenty of liquidity left from stimulus measures to prop up the market.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In fact, stocks surged 18% during QT from October 2017 through July 2019, Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, wrote in a recent note. Meantime, a survey conducted by DeBusschere’s firm showed that over half of the respondents believe QT will push Treasury yields higher, 32% say they will be unchanged and only 12% bet on a drop.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Fed “should not blink” as it addresses hot inflation, and Powell faces a “huge” challenge finding ways to cool price growth without damaging the economy, Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz SE, told Bloomberg Television.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “We are confident that Powell’s commentary will be void of any major-market moving surprises,” said Robert Schein, chief investment officer at Blanke Schein Wealth Management. Should Friday’s PCE inflation reading top forecasts, “that will firmly quash any expectations of a policy pivot,” he added.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Investors also waded through data showing the government’s main measures of US growth pointed in different directions in the first half of 2022, adding to the ongoing debate on the health of the economy. Another report showed applications for unemployment benefits fell for a second week, suggesting employers are holding on to workers despite growing uncertainties.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In corporate news, China stocks listed in the US rallied as talks between both countries to avoid delisting of firms on the New York Stock Exchange ramp up. Snowflake Inc. surged as an upbeat forecast reassured Wall Street that companies are still investing in their technology systems to boost efficiency. Peloton Interactive Inc. tumbled as a bleak outlook renewed concerns about the fitness company’s comeback plan.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Read: US Corporate Profits Soar, Taking Margins to Widest Since 1950\n </p>\n <p>\n  What to watch this week:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Fed Chair Powell speaks at Jackson Hole, Friday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   US personal income, PCE deflator, University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Friday\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Will the meme mania fizzle out?

Following the slowest trading day of 2022 for US equities, volume was once again below average. Megacaps like Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. jumped, though Tesla Inc. whipsawed as its stock split took effect. Treasury 10-year rates traded near 3%, while the dollar slipped.\nInvestors were mostly unfazed by hawkish comments from Fed officials gathering for the annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Powell’s speech at 10 a.m. Washington time Friday will mark the highlight of an event that’s been used for making key announcements. The Fed’s boss is widely expected to restate his resolve to keep tightening policy to fight inflationary spirals.\n“We are not convinced Jackson Hole tomorrow will be a negative market shock because expectations are hawkish while exposure still low,” said Dennis DeBusschere, founder of 22V Research. “We thought the market correction would be leading into Jackson Hole, and that has largely played out. We are neutral short term.”\nRead: Fed Officials Push for More Hikes; Bullard Favors Front-Loading\nTraders will also be watching out for any signals about the pace of the Fed’s balance-sheet runoff -- known as quantitative tightening -- which gets up to full speed in September at a monthly clip of up to $95 billion. While some strategists are convinced the unwinding could pose a threat to equities, others say there’s still plenty of liquidity left from stimulus measures to prop up the market.\nIn fact, stocks surged 18% during QT from October 2017 through July 2019, Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, wrote in a recent note. Meantime, a survey conducted by DeBusschere’s firm showed that over half of the respondents believe QT will push Treasury yields higher, 32% say they will be unchanged and only 12% bet on a drop.\nThe Fed “should not blink” as it addresses hot inflation, and Powell faces a “huge” challenge finding ways to cool price growth without damaging the economy, Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz SE, told Bloomberg Television.\n“We are confident that Powell’s commentary will be void of any major-market moving surprises,” said Robert Schein, chief investment officer at Blanke Schein Wealth Management. Should Friday’s PCE inflation reading top forecasts, “that will firmly quash any expectations of a policy pivot,” he added.\nInvestors also waded through data showing the government’s main measures of US growth pointed in different directions in the first half of 2022, adding to the ongoing debate on the health of the economy. Another report showed applications for unemployment benefits fell for a second week, suggesting employers are holding on to workers despite growing uncertainties.\nIn corporate news, China stocks listed in the US rallied as talks between both countries to avoid delisting of firms on the New York Stock Exchange ramp up. Snowflake Inc. surged as an upbeat forecast reassured Wall Street that companies are still investing in their technology systems to boost efficiency. Peloton Interactive Inc. tumbled as a bleak outlook renewed concerns about the fitness company’s comeback plan.\nRead: US Corporate Profits Soar, Taking Margins to Widest Since 1950\nWhat to watch this week:\nFed Chair Powell speaks at Jackson Hole, FridayUS personal income, PCE deflator, University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Friday\nFed Chair Powell speaks at Jackson Hole, Friday\nUS personal income, PCE deflator, University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Friday\nWill the meme mania fizzle out?

The macro-heavy next two weeks should bring about more clarity in this matter.”“It is patently clear that the Fed has inflation reduction as its main aim, even though it acknowledges the knock-on risk of derailing the economy,” Richard Hunter, the head of markets at Interactive Investor International in Leeds, UK, said. “Comments from several Fed officials suggest that there remains some way to go before victory can be declared on taming inflation.”\n“Markets have been rallying on the back of three assumptions: a moderated recession-to-come, a Fed pivot and an earnings expansion: from that perspective, this week has been sobering with notably a negative macro news flow,” Florian Ielpo, head of macro research at Lombard Odier Asset Management, wrote. “This week, we have seen a pause in this bear market rally which has not yet mutated into a turning point.

    "body": "<body>\n <p>\n  Stocks finished the week on solid footing, with traders assessing whether an inflation slowdown could soon make the Federal Reserve reduce the pace of its most-aggressive tightening campaign in decades and prevent a hard landing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Defying the crowd of skeptics who dubbed the rebound a bear-market rally or short-covering, the S&amp;P 500 had a fourth straight week of gains, the longest such run since November. The gauge recouped more than 50% of the losses it notched between its January peak and June nadir, and approached its 200-day average -- a line crossed by the Russell 2000 of small caps. The Nasdaq 100 pushed further beyond its technical bull-market threshold, following a surge of over 20% from June lows.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As equities climbed, Wall Street’s fear gauge crumbled. The Cboe Volatility Index slumped back below 20, the average level since its inception. The VIX notched its eighth straight week of declines, the longest losing stretch since 2019. Meantime, the S&amp;P 500’s 14-day relative strength index (RSI) topped 70 -- which is seen by some traders as one indication of an overbought market.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The next few weeks will be crucial in determining the sustainability of the rally. With the earnings season almost over, economic reports mixed at best and many Fed speakers unwillling to sound too dovish, some analysts see the chances of a breather. To Matt Maley at Miller Tabak, stocks are indeed getting overbought on a very-short-term basis, so a decline or sideways move “would not be the worst development in the world.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  For now, flows have been robust.

    "content": "Stocks finished the week on solid footing, with traders assessing whether an inflation slowdown could soon make the Federal Reserve reduce the pace of its most-aggressive tightening campaign in decades and prevent a hard landing.\nDefying the crowd of skeptics who dubbed the rebound a bear-market rally or short-covering, the S&P 500 had a fourth straight week of gains, the longest such run since November. The gauge recouped more than 50% of the losses it notched between its January peak and June nadir, and approached its 200-day average -- a line crossed by the Russell 2000 of small caps. The Nasdaq 100 pushed further beyond its technical bull-market threshold, following a surge of over 20% from June lows.\nAs equities climbed, Wall Street’s fear gauge crumbled. The Cboe Volatility Index slumped back below 20, the average level since its inception. The VIX notched its eighth straight week of declines, the longest losing stretch since 2019. Meantime, the S&P 500’s 14-day relative strength index (RSI) topped 70 -- which is seen by some traders as one indication of an overbought market.\nThe next few weeks will be crucial in determining the sustainability of the rally. With the earnings season almost over, economic reports mixed at best and many Fed speakers unwillling to sound too dovish, some analysts see the chances of a breather. To Matt Maley at Miller Tabak, stocks are indeed getting overbought on a very-short-term basis, so a decline or sideways move “would not be the worst development in the world.”\nFor now, flows have been robust.

Swaps are now suggesting a move of 50 basis points as more likely in September than a repeat of the 75-basis-point increases that officials have opted to implement at their past two meetings.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “This is overall good news for risky assets,” wrote Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Asset Management, adding that “a lower growth rate of prices does not mean the end of inflation, and naturally the end of hawkish central banking. Inflation remains a situation that requires the Fed’s attention and more importantly the Fed’s measures.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  One danger of the stock-market bullishness right now is it could cause a relaxation of financial conditions that would go against the Fed’s goals. It’s also worth looking back to the early 1980s, when then Fed Chair Paul Volcker eased policy as inflation peaked and the economy tipped into a recession. But the moderation of price pressures proved to be much slower than officials wanted -- and they had to tighten again months later.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In fact, the CPI surprise is just one piece of the intricate puzzle officials are playing with at the moment -- and possibly over the next several months -- with the central bank still miles away from reaching its inflation target. Food prices in the US soared the most since 1979 in July, keeping the cost of living painfully high even as lower gasoline costs offered some relief to consumers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Two Fed officials responded to softening inflation data by saying it doesn’t change the US central bank’s path toward even higher rates this year and next.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Alluding to market pricing of the policy trajectory, Fed Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari said it was not realistic to conclude the central bank will start cutting rates in early 2023. His Chicago counterpart Charles Evans said officials will probably continue hiking into next year to bring down “unacceptably high” inflation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “The easing of financial conditions likely annoys the Fed, and we should not be surprised to see Fed speakers continue to try to talk down the market and risk assets,” said Christian Hoffmann, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management.\n </p>\n <h3>\n  More comments on CPI:\n </h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   “The Fed still has significantly further to tighten and the US economy ultimately cannot avoid its fate. Enjoy today and the next few weeks, it won’t last for too long,” said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   “This data point will fuel talk of a policy pivot. But, for me, the issue really does boil down to the labor market. Wage growth is running red hot and absent a turn around in productivity, this will ultimately fuel higher prices,” wrote Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   “This is a step in the right direction, but keep in mind we have many miles ahead of us before inflation normalizes. One month’s data point does not make a trend, however, so cautious optimism is likely the name of the game,” said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   “Wow, finally the anecdotal evidence that inflation was easing has finally showed up in a mainstream inflation report. The Fed is rapidly losing its case for further tightening and this report reinforces for investors that either a new easing cycle has already begun or we are getting very close to one,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  In corporate news, Tesla Inc. climbed after Elon Musk offloaded $6.9 billion of stock in the electric-vehicle maker to accumulate cash ahead of a trial that could force the billionaire to follow through on an agreement to acquire Twitter Inc. Wendy’s Co. became the latest restaurant chain to show signs of strain thanks to rising inflation as sales and restaurant margin fell short of Wall Street projections.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After the close of regular trading, Walt Disney Co. said it will raise the price of its flagship Disney+ streaming service by 38%. That’s part of a plan to generate more revenue for its money-losing online businesses and build on third-quarter results that beat estimates for sales, profit and subscriber growth.

Food prices in the US soared the most since 1979 in July, keeping the cost of living painfully high even as lower gasoline costs offered some relief to consumers.\nTwo Fed officials responded to softening inflation data by saying it doesn’t change the US central bank’s path toward even higher rates this year and next.\nAlluding to market pricing of the policy trajectory, Fed Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari said it was not realistic to conclude the central bank will start cutting rates in early 2023. His Chicago counterpart Charles Evans said officials will probably continue hiking into next year to bring down “unacceptably high” inflation.\n“The easing of financial conditions likely annoys the Fed, and we should not be surprised to see Fed speakers continue to try to talk down the market and risk assets,” said Christian Hoffmann, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management.\nMore comments on CPI:\n“The Fed still has significantly further to tighten and the US economy ultimately cannot avoid its fate. Enjoy today and the next few weeks, it won’t last for too long,” said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors.“This data point will fuel talk of a policy pivot. But, for me, the issue really does boil down to the labor market. Wage growth is running red hot and absent a turn around in productivity, this will ultimately fuel higher prices,” wrote Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research.“This is a step in the right direction, but keep in mind we have many miles ahead of us before inflation normalizes. One month’s data point does not make a trend, however, so cautious optimism is likely the name of the game,” said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.“Wow, finally the anecdotal evidence that inflation was easing has finally showed up in a mainstream inflation report. The Fed is rapidly losing its case for further tightening and this report reinforces for investors that either a new easing cycle has already begun or we are getting very close to one,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group.\n“The Fed still has significantly further to tighten and the US economy ultimately cannot avoid its fate.

Wendy’s Co. became the latest restaurant chain to show signs of strain thanks to rising inflation as sales and restaurant margin fell short of Wall Street projections.\nAfter the close of regular trading, Walt Disney Co. said it will raise the price of its flagship Disney+ streaming service by 38%. That’s part of a plan to generate more revenue for its money-losing online businesses and build on third-quarter results that beat estimates for sales, profit and subscriber growth. The shares jumped.\nRespected for decades for combining decent returns and relatively low volatility, the 60/40 portfolio has generated a 11.5% loss so far this year.

But the index and the Nasdaq 100 wrapped up their third straight week of gains, the longest rising streak since April for both. Treasuries sank, with the 10-year yield around 2.83% after climbing nearly 26 basis points since Monday.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The strong jobs report validated the Fed’s view of a resilient economy that can withstand additional interest-rate hikes. Traders have now recalibrated expectations for Fed policy, with a hike of three-quarters of a percentage point the more likely scenario at the September meeting as the central bank battles inflation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A handful of Fed officials this week reiterated the central bank’s resolve to bring down high prices. Among them is Fed St Louis President James Bullard, who has said he favors a strategy of front-loading big interest-rate hikes.

For markets, the report may pose a challenge for rate-sensitive equities like tech which had recently been leading in terms of sector performance.”\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   “All the jobs lost during the pandemic have now been regained.

    "body": "<body>\n <p>\n  US stocks turned sharply lower after Apple Inc.’s plans to slow hiring added to investor worries that the Federal Reserve’s campaign against inflation will drop the economy into a recession.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The S&amp;P 500 extended losses in the last hour of trading, after coughing up a gain that had surpassed 1%. Tech and health-care shares led the drop, with Apple sliding more than 2% in its worst day in almost three weeks. The iPhone maker plans to slow hiring and spending growth next year in some divisions to cope with a potential economic downturn, people with knowledge of the matter said. The news follows a similar move by Alphabet Inc. last week.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Netflix Inc. will kick off second-quarter earnings for major tech and communication companies when it reports Tuesday evening. Profit growth for the sector is expected to slow sharply. Earlier, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reported better-than-expected results, sending its shares higher.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stocks had been rebounding from their June low on expectations that the Fed is starting to gain ground in its efforts to slow price gains. Treasuries slumped Monday, with 10-year yields below 3% -- still lower than the 2-year rate, leaving the curve inverted in what is generally a recession warning.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “What’s been holding us up of course is jobs, so now as we start to get these announcements jobs aren’t maybe as stable, now you’re seeing the impetus toward recession,” said Dana D’Auria, co-CIO at Envestnet Solutions, on Bloomberg Television.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After the bell, International Business Machines Corp. reported sales that beat estimates, a sign that demand for mainframe computers, consulting and cloud services remained strong. The shares were little changed in extended trading.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another pressure point for markets remains gas supply to Europe amid a standoff with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, with the Nord Stream 1 pipeline scheduled to reopen Thursday following maintenance. Gazprom PJSC declared force majeure on several European natural-gas buyers, a move that may signal it intends to keep supplies capped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Read more: Russian Gas Supply Halt Risks 1.5% Cut to EU’s GDP in Worst Case\n </p>\n <p>\n  The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 5% from June’s closing low following Friday’s strong rally on renewed hopes that inflation -- and Fed rate hikes -- may be close to peaking. Data last week showing a greater decline in US consumers’ long-term inflation expectations helped squash talk of a 100 basis-point hike in July, while strong retail sales underscored a resilient economy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Read more: Trader Behind Huge Fed Funds Wager Bags $14 Million in First Day\n </p>\n <p>\n  “You have to be very careful in how you’re allocating assets and allocating dollars in this market -- but you had a couple of really good numbers this morning from Goldman and Bank of America, on the back of good retail sales,” said Chuck Cumello, president and chief executive officer of Essex Financial Services. “And the key thing in the US economy is the consumer” and, he said, “people are out spending.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  Elsewhere in markets Monday, West Texas Intermediate crude climbed above $100 a barrel after the Saudis declined to make any promises regarding future output increases, and copper extended its recovery from last week’s slump. Bitcoin rallied, trading above $22,000 for the first time since early June.\n </p>\n <p>\n  More market commentary\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   “The key for the markets continues to be the overall direction of the economy,” wrote Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management. “If the recession that is heading our way is mild, then much of the decline has already occurred, and this is a good time to accumulate shares. If the recession is deeper/longer, then there is a risk of another 15% decline in stocks from here.”\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   “Our call remains that the economy will slow aggressively over the next 6-12 months and bond yields are headed lower, but a recession is not imminent,” wrote Dennis DeBusschere, the founder of 22V Research. “That backdrop has implications for factors and markets near term, especially as disinflationary forces continue to strengthen.”\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   “The possibility that Russia stops, or severely reduces, their gas exports to Europe should keep markets on edge in the near-term,” Mizuho International Plc strategists Peter McCallum and Evelyne Gomez-Liechti wrote in a note to clients.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Key events to watch this week:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Earnings this week include Tesla\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen visits South Korea. Tuesday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Reserve Bank of Australia releases July minutes. Tuesday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   UK Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey speak at event.

    "content": "US stocks turned sharply lower after Apple Inc.’s plans to slow hiring added to investor worries that the Federal Reserve’s campaign against inflation will drop the economy into a recession.\nThe S&P 500 extended losses in the last hour of trading, after coughing up a gain that had surpassed 1%. Tech and health-care shares led the drop, with Apple sliding more than 2% in its worst day in almost three weeks. The iPhone maker plans to slow hiring and spending growth next year in some divisions to cope with a potential economic downturn, people with knowledge of the matter said. The news follows a similar move by Alphabet Inc. last week. \nNetflix Inc. will kick off second-quarter earnings for major tech and communication companies when it reports Tuesday evening. Profit growth for the sector is expected to slow sharply. Earlier, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reported better-than-expected results, sending its shares higher.\nStocks had been rebounding from their June low on expectations that the Fed is starting to gain ground in its efforts to slow price gains. Treasuries slumped Monday, with 10-year yields below 3% -- still lower than the 2-year rate, leaving the curve inverted in what is generally a recession warning.\n“What’s been holding us up of course is jobs, so now as we start to get these announcements jobs aren’t maybe as stable, now you’re seeing the impetus toward recession,” said Dana D’Auria, co-CIO at Envestnet Solutions, on Bloomberg Television.\nAfter the bell, International Business Machines Corp. reported sales that beat estimates, a sign that demand for mainframe computers, consulting and cloud services remained strong. The shares were little changed in extended trading.\nAnother pressure point for markets remains gas supply to Europe amid a standoff with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, with the Nord Stream 1 pipeline scheduled to reopen Thursday following maintenance. Gazprom PJSC declared force majeure on several European natural-gas buyers, a move that may signal it intends to keep supplies capped.\nRead more: Russian Gas Supply Halt Risks 1.5% Cut to EU’s GDP in Worst Case\nThe S&P 500 is up more than 5% from June’s closing low following Friday’s strong rally on renewed hopes that inflation -- and Fed rate hikes -- may be close to peaking. Data last week showing a greater decline in US consumers’ long-term inflation expectations helped squash talk of a 100 basis-point hike in July, while strong retail sales underscored a resilient economy.\nRead more: Trader Behind Huge Fed Funds Wager Bags $14 Million in First Day\n“You have to be very careful in how you’re allocating assets and allocating dollars in this market -- but you had a couple of really good numbers this morning from Goldman and Bank of America, on the back of good retail sales,” said Chuck Cumello, president and chief executive officer of Essex Financial Services. “And the key thing in the US economy is the consumer” and, he said, “people are out spending.”\nElsewhere in markets Monday, West Texas Intermediate crude climbed above $100 a barrel after the Saudis declined to make any promises regarding future output increases, and copper extended its recovery from last week’s slump. Bitcoin rallied, trading above $22,000 for the first time since early June.\nMore market commentary\n“The key for the markets continues to be the overall direction of the economy,” wrote Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management. “If the recession that is heading our way is mild, then much of the decline has already occurred, and this is a good time to accumulate shares. If the recession is deeper/longer, then there is a risk of another 15% decline in stocks from here.”“Our call remains that the economy will slow aggressively over the next 6-12 months and bond yields are headed lower, but a recession is not imminent,” wrote Dennis DeBusschere, the founder of 22V Research. “That backdrop has implications for factors and markets near term, especially as disinflationary forces continue to strengthen.”“The possibility that Russia stops, or severely reduces, their gas exports to Europe should keep markets on edge in the near-term,” Mizuho International Plc strategists Peter McCallum and Evelyne Gomez-Liechti wrote in a note to clients.\n“The key for the markets continues to be the overall direction of the economy,” wrote Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management. “If the recession that is heading our way is mild, then much of the decline has already occurred, and this is a good time to accumulate shares.

The Fed will likely resort to hawkish rhetoric and further front-loading of tightening as it fights to maintain its credibility, according to Federated Hermes’ Silvia Dall’Angelo.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “The June CPI print is ugly across the board,” wrote Krishna Guha, vice chairman at Evercore ISI. “This is bad news for risk assets as it increases the likelihood that the Fed will keep raising rates rapidly and end up overshooting by enough to push the economy into recession.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bank of America Corp. economists forecast a “mild recession this year” in the US, saying services spending is slowing and hot inflation is spurring consumers to pull back. They join Wells Fargo Investment Institute and Nomura Holdings Inc. in expecting a contraction in 2022.

The percentage of S&amp;P 500 members with a dividend yield higher than the 10-year US Treasury rate has fallen to the lowest since 2007. Payouts are under pressure as companies grapple with fears of recession, historically high inflation and supply constraints.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In corporate news, Delta Air Lines Inc. fell short of profit expectations in the second quarter and said high operating costs will persist through the rest of the year. Spirit Airlines Inc. agreed to delay a planned shareholder vote yet again on a proposed acquisition by Frontier Group Holdings Inc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Investors fixated on the looming risk of recession are about to get a crucial read on a question that’s been burning a hole through markets for months: whether bank earnings will show cracks forming in the economy.

The Fed will likely resort to hawkish rhetoric and further front-loading of tightening as it fights to maintain its credibility, according to Federated Hermes’ Silvia Dall’Angelo.\n“The June CPI print is ugly across the board,” wrote Krishna Guha, vice chairman at Evercore ISI. “This is bad news for risk assets as it increases the likelihood that the Fed will keep raising rates rapidly and end up overshooting by enough to push the economy into recession.”\nBank of America Corp. economists forecast a “mild recession this year” in the US, saying services spending is slowing and hot inflation is spurring consumers to pull back. They join Wells Fargo Investment Institute and Nomura Holdings Inc. in expecting a contraction in 2022.

The percentage of S&P 500 members with a dividend yield higher than the 10-year US Treasury rate has fallen to the lowest since 2007. Payouts are under pressure as companies grapple with fears of recession, historically high inflation and supply constraints.\nIn corporate news, Delta Air Lines Inc. fell short of profit expectations in the second quarter and said high operating costs will persist through the rest of the year. Spirit Airlines Inc. agreed to delay a planned shareholder vote yet again on a proposed acquisition by Frontier Group Holdings Inc.\nInvestors fixated on the looming risk of recession are about to get a crucial read on a question that’s been burning a hole through markets for months: whether bank earnings will show cracks forming in the economy.

A US inflation reading on Wednesday is expected to get closer to 9%, buttressing the Federal Reserve’s case for a jumbo rate boost in July.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steep Fed hikes and recession fears have lifted the greenback to the highest levels since March 2020. The dollar surge will be a “massive headwind” for profits at many large US firms and another reason to expect a dimming earnings outlook, wrote Michael Wilson, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Billionaire investor Leon Cooperman said that a stronger dollar is indeed “negative for corporate profits.” In fact, several firms like giants Microsoft Corp., Costco Wholesale Corp. and Salesforce Inc. have also bemoaned the impacts of the US currency’s meteoric ascent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For Wilson, the S&amp;P 500’s bear market will continue, and he sees fair value at 3,400-3,500 in case of a soft landing and 3,000 in a recession -- a 22% downside from Monday’s close.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “A stagflationary stall is as probable as an outright recession,” wrote Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Read: Gross Favors T-Bills Over Stocks, Bonds as Recession Looms Large\n </p>\n <p>\n  Meantime, Citigroup Inc. strategists pointed out that there’s a strong correlation between the Fed’s rate trajectory and earnings growth. They said it’s been common for profits to rise as the Fed tightens its policy, and to contract when the central bank switches to easing in response to economic weakness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That means corporate earnings should remain resilient to surging inflation and slowing growth, paving the way for battered US stocks to rally in the remainder of 2022, they added.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As big banks kick off the earnings season this week, traders will be looking for clues about the health of the consumer and spending trends as well as lending to businesses and corporate confidence. Real-estate valuations and lending may also be key for market direction, along with thoughts on the state of capital markets.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Results from the FAANG cohort of megacaps like Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. and Google’s parent Alphabet Inc. won’t come out until later this month. But investors are getting ready for heightened volatility as profit cuts by industry analysts have been lagging, leaving room for big surprises and dramatic post-earnings moves.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Elsewhere, Bitcoin fell again -- and Wall Street expects the cryptocurrency’s selloff to get a whole lot worse. The token is more likely to tumble to $10,000, cutting its value roughly in half, than it is to rally back to $30,000, according to 60% of the 950 investors who responded to the latest MLIV Pulse survey. The tally also showed that 40% saw it going the other way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Crude declined amid a renewed increase in China’s virus cases, while a court order allowed the crucial CPC terminal on Russia’s Black Sea coast to stay operational -- easing some supply concerns.

The dollar surge will be a “massive headwind” for profits at many large US firms and another reason to expect a dimming earnings outlook, wrote Michael Wilson, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley.\nBillionaire investor Leon Cooperman said that a stronger dollar is indeed “negative for corporate profits.” In fact, several firms like giants Microsoft Corp., Costco Wholesale Corp. and Salesforce Inc. have also bemoaned the impacts of the US currency’s meteoric ascent.\nFor Wilson, the S&P 500’s bear market will continue, and he sees fair value at 3,400-3,500 in case of a soft landing and 3,000 in a recession -- a 22% downside from Monday’s close.\n“A stagflationary stall is as probable as an outright recession,” wrote Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.\nRead: Gross Favors T-Bills Over Stocks, Bonds as Recession Looms Large\nMeantime, Citigroup Inc. strategists pointed out that there’s a strong correlation between the Fed’s rate trajectory and earnings growth. They said it’s been common for profits to rise as the Fed tightens its policy, and to contract when the central bank switches to easing in response to economic weakness.\nThat means corporate earnings should remain resilient to surging inflation and slowing growth, paving the way for battered US stocks to rally in the remainder of 2022, they added.\nAs big banks kick off the earnings season this week, traders will be looking for clues about the health of the consumer and spending trends as well as lending to businesses and corporate confidence. Real-estate valuations and lending may also be key for market direction, along with thoughts on the state of capital markets.\nResults from the FAANG cohort of megacaps like Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. and Google’s parent Alphabet Inc. won’t come out until later this month. But investors are getting ready for heightened volatility as profit cuts by industry analysts have been lagging, leaving room for big surprises and dramatic post-earnings moves.\nElsewhere, Bitcoin fell again -- and Wall Street expects the cryptocurrency’s selloff to get a whole lot worse. The token is more likely to tumble to $10,000, cutting its value roughly in half, than it is to rally back to $30,000, according to 60% of the 950 investors who responded to the latest MLIV Pulse survey. The tally also showed that 40% saw it going the other way.\nCrude declined amid a renewed increase in China’s virus cases, while a court order allowed the crucial CPC terminal on Russia’s Black Sea coast to stay operational -- easing some supply concerns. Chicago corn futures climbed as US forecasts point to a heat wave during the crop’s key development period. \nRead: Commodity Bull Case Intact After Selloff, Hedge Fund Boss Says\nWhat to watch this week:\nEarnings due from JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Wells FargoBOE Governor Andrew Bailey discusses the economic landscape, TuesdayAmazon.com Inc. kicks off its Prime Day event, TuesdaySouth Korea, New Zealand rate decisions, WednesdayUS CPI data, WednesdayFederal Reserve Beige Book, WednesdayUS PPI, jobless claims, ThursdayChina GDP, FridayUS business inventories, industrial production, University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Empire manufacturing, retail sales, FridayG-20 finance ministers, central bankers meet in Bali, from FridayAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks, Friday\nEarnings due from JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Wells Fargo\nBOE Governor Andrew Bailey discusses the economic landscape, Tuesday\nAmazon.com Inc. kicks off its Prime Day event, Tuesday\nSouth Korea, New Zealand rate decisions, Wednesday\nUS CPI data, Wednesday\nFederal Reserve Beige Book, Wednesday\nUS PPI, jobless claims, Thursday\nChina GDP, Friday\nUS business inventories, industrial production, University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Empire manufacturing, retail sales, Friday\nG-20 finance ministers, central bankers meet in Bali, from Friday\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks, Friday\nSome of the main moves in markets:\nStocks\nThe S&P 500 fell 1.2% as of 4 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 fell 2.2%The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5%The MSCI World index fell 1.3%\nThe S&P 500 fell 1.2% as of 4 p.m. New York time\nThe Nasdaq 100 fell 2.2%\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5%\nThe MSCI World index fell 1.3%\nCurrencies\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 1%The euro fell 1.4% to $1.0044The British pound fell 1.1% to $1.1895The Japanese yen fell 1% to 137.41 per dollar\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 1%\nThe euro fell 1.4% to $1.0044\nThe British pound fell 1.1% to $1.1895\nThe Japanese yen fell 1% to 137.41 per dollar\nBonds\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries declined nine basis points to 2.99%Germany’s 10-year yield declined 10 basis points to 1.25%Britain’s 10-year yield declined six basis points to 2.18%\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries declined nine basis points to 2.99%\nGermany’s 10-year yield declined 10 basis points to 1.25%\nBritain’s 10-year yield declined six basis points to 2.18%\nCommodities\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 1.3% to $103.44 a barrelGold futures fell 0.6% to $1,731 an ounce\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 1.3% to $103.44 a barrel\nGold futures fell 0.6% to $1,731 an ounce\n",

    "content": "US stocks rose for the third straight day as investors parsed economic data that hinted at slightly slower growth, prompting some to brush off the hawkish stance that the Federal Reserve reiterated in its June meeting minutes as outdated. \nThe S&P 500 ended the session up 0.4% after swinging between gains and losses as investors digested a flurry of data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, whose members have been more sensitive to the rise in bond yields, also rose. The two- and 10-year US Treasury yield curve remained inverted.
