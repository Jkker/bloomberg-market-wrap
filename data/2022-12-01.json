Almost half of the 388 respondents to the latest MLIV Pulse survey said a scenario where growth continues to slow while inflation remains elevated will dominate globally next year.\nElsewhere, oil climbed as OPEC+ is seen considering deeper output cuts amid a faltering market.\nRead: Long-Dated Credit Does Best Since 2008 as Buyers Bet on Pivot\nKey events this week:\nEuro area economic confidence, consumer confidence, TuesdayUS Conference Board consumer confidence, TuesdayEIA crude oil inventory report, WednesdayChina PMI, WednesdayFed Chair Jerome Powell speech, WednesdayFed releases its Beige Book, WednesdayUS wholesale inventories, GDP, WednesdayS&P Global PMIs, ThursdayUS construction spending, consumer income, initial jobless claims, ISM Manufacturing, ThursdayBOJ’s Haruhiko Kuroda speaks, ThursdayUS unemployment, nonfarm payrolls, FridayECB’s Christine Lagarde speaks, Friday\nEuro area economic confidence, consumer confidence, Tuesday\nUS Conference Board consumer confidence, Tuesday\nEIA crude oil inventory report, Wednesday\nChina PMI, Wednesday\nFed Chair Jerome Powell speech, Wednesday\nFed releases its Beige Book, Wednesday\nUS wholesale inventories, GDP, Wednesday\nS&P Global PMIs, Thursday\nUS construction spending, consumer income, initial jobless claims, ISM Manufacturing, Thursday\nBOJ’s Haruhiko Kuroda speaks, Thursday\nUS unemployment, nonfarm payrolls, Friday\nECB’s Christine Lagarde speaks, Friday\nSome of the main moves in markets:\nStocks\nThe S&P 500 fell 1.5% as of 4 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 fell 1.4%The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4%The MSCI World index fell 1.4%\nThe S&P 500 fell 1.5% as of 4 p.m. New York time\nThe Nasdaq 100 fell 1.4%\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4%\nThe MSCI World index fell 1.4%\nCurrencies\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.6%The euro fell 0.6% to $1.0336The British pound fell 1.2% to $1.1949The Japanese yen rose 0.2% to 138.93 per dollar\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.6%\nThe euro fell 0.6% to $1.0336\nThe British pound fell 1.2% to $1.1949\nThe Japanese yen rose 0.2% to 138.93 per dollar\nCryptocurrencies\nBitcoin fell 1.9% to $16,252.51Ether fell 3.4% to $1,174.4\nBitcoin fell 1.9% to $16,252.51\nEther fell 3.4% to $1,174.4\nBonds\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced one basis point to 3.69%Germany’s 10-year yield advanced two basis points to 1.99%Britain’s 10-year yield was little changed at 3.13%\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced one basis point to 3.69%\nGermany’s 10-year yield advanced two basis points to 1.99%\nBritain’s 10-year yield was little changed at 3.13%\nCommodities\nWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.8% to $76.87 a barrelGold futures fell 0.8% to $1,754.50 an ounce\nWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.8% to $76.87 a barrel\nGold futures fell 0.8% to $1,754.50 an ounce\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n",

    "body": "<body>\n <p>\n  US stocks dropped as investors parsed comments from Federal Reserve officials who broadly remained steadfast in their fight against inflation. Mounting concerns that China may tighten Covid curbs after a string of reported deaths also continued to weigh on investors.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Technology stocks, which are typically more sensitive to interest rates, dragged the S&amp;P 500 lower. The Nasdaq 100 ended the day down 1.1%. Oil emerged from a volatile session largely unchanged after Saudi Arabia denied a report that it is discussing an oil-production increase for the OPEC+ meeting next month. The dollar climbed for a third day as investors sought haven assets. Treasuries were mixed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Investors are closely watching what Fed speakers say about the outlook for interest rates. While several central bank officials in recent days have restated their intention to remain relentless until inflation is under control, they differ on how far they’ll go. On Monday, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said that officials will need to be mindful of the lags with which monetary policy is transmitted through the economy as they raise rates further. Her Cleveland counterpart Loretta Mester said she’s open to slowing the tempo of rate hikes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “This shouldn’t be regarded as a pivot or anything new,” said Michael Contopoulos, director of fixed income at Richard Bernstein Advisors. “A real pivot is when the Fed starts to cut rates and/or pause quantitative tightening. That is nowhere in sight.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, meanwhile, has said he favors slowing the pace of interest rate increases, with no more than 1 percentage point more of hikes, to try to ensure the economy has a soft landing. Boston Fed President Susan Collins has reiterated her view that options are open for the size of the December interest-rate increase, including the possibility of a 75 basis-point move.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Traders this week will also be looking to minutes of the most recent Fed policy meeting for further clues on the central bank’s path ahead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “For the Fed right now, if we do get some slowing in inflation -- which it seems like we might -- but you’re not seeing it in the slowing of service inflation, that’s related to a tight labor market,” Veronica Clark, economist at Citigroup, said on Bloomberg Television. “You do need to see that loosening in the labor market data.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  Meanwhile, China saw its first Covid-related death in almost six months on Saturday and another two were reported on Sunday. Worsening outbreaks across the nation are stoking concerns that authorities may again resort to harsh restrictions. Shutdowns could have a negative impact on supply-chain dynamics and possibly exacerbate inflation issues across economies.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Key events this week:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   US Richmond Fed manufacturing index, Tuesday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   OECD releases Economic Outlook, Tuesday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Fed’s Loretta Mester and James Bullard speak, Tuesday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   S&amp;P Global PMIs: US, Euro area, UK, Wednesday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   US MBA mortgage applications, durable goods, initial jobless claims, University of Michigan sentiment, new home sales, Wednesday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s Nov. 1-2 meeting, Wednesday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   ECB publishes account of its October policy meeting, Thursday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   US stock and bond markets are closed for the Thanksgiving holiday, Thursday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   US stock and bond markets close early, Friday\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Some of the main moves in markets :\n </p>\n <h3>\n  Stocks\n </h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.4% as of 4:01 p.m. New York time\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The Nasdaq 100 fell 1.1%\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The MSCI World index rose 0.6%\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <h3>\n  Currencies\n </h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.7%\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The euro fell 0.8% to $1.0239\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The British pound fell 0.6% to $1.1818\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The Japanese yen fell 1.2% to 142.11 per dollar\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <h3>\n  Cryptocurrencies\n </h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Bitcoin fell 2.8% to $15,800.01\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Ether fell 3.2% to $1,104.71\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <h3>\n  Bonds\n </h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 3.83%\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Germany’s 10-year yield declined two basis points to 1.99%\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Britain’s 10-year yield declined five basis points to 3.19%\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <h3>\n  Commodities\n </h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   West Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.4% to $79.73 a barrel\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Gold futures fell 0.8% to $1,755.20 an ounce\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  This story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n </p>\n <ol>\n </ol>\n</body>",

While several central bank officials in recent days have restated their intention to remain relentless until inflation is under control, they differ on how far they’ll go. On Monday, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said that officials will need to be mindful of the lags with which monetary policy is transmitted through the economy as they raise rates further. Her Cleveland counterpart Loretta Mester said she’s open to slowing the tempo of rate hikes. \n“This shouldn’t be regarded as a pivot or anything new,” said Michael Contopoulos, director of fixed income at Richard Bernstein Advisors. “A real pivot is when the Fed starts to cut rates and/or pause quantitative tightening. That is nowhere in sight.”\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, meanwhile, has said he favors slowing the pace of interest rate increases, with no more than 1 percentage point more of hikes, to try to ensure the economy has a soft landing. Boston Fed President Susan Collins has reiterated her view that options are open for the size of the December interest-rate increase, including the possibility of a 75 basis-point move. \nTraders this week will also be looking to minutes of the most recent Fed policy meeting for further clues on the central bank’s path ahead. \n“For the Fed right now, if we do get some slowing in inflation -- which it seems like we might -- but you’re not seeing it in the slowing of service inflation, that’s related to a tight labor market,” Veronica Clark, economist at Citigroup, said on Bloomberg Television. “You do need to see that loosening in the labor market data.” \nMeanwhile, China saw its first Covid-related death in almost six months on Saturday and another two were reported on Sunday. Worsening outbreaks across the nation are stoking concerns that authorities may again resort to harsh restrictions. Shutdowns could have a negative impact on supply-chain dynamics and possibly exacerbate inflation issues across economies. \nKey events this week:\nUS Richmond Fed manufacturing index, TuesdayOECD releases Economic Outlook, TuesdayFed’s Loretta Mester and James Bullard speak, TuesdayS&P Global PMIs: US, Euro area, UK, WednesdayUS MBA mortgage applications, durable goods, initial jobless claims, University of Michigan sentiment, new home sales, WednesdayMinutes of the Federal Reserve’s Nov. 1-2 meeting, WednesdayECB publishes account of its October policy meeting, ThursdayUS stock and bond markets are closed for the Thanksgiving holiday, ThursdayUS stock and bond markets close early, Friday\nUS Richmond Fed manufacturing index, Tuesday\nOECD releases Economic Outlook, Tuesday\nFed’s Loretta Mester and James Bullard speak, Tuesday\nS&P Global PMIs: US, Euro area, UK, Wednesday\nUS MBA mortgage applications, durable goods, initial jobless claims, University of Michigan sentiment, new home sales, Wednesday\nMinutes of the Federal Reserve’s Nov. 1-2 meeting, Wednesday\nECB publishes account of its October policy meeting, Thursday\nUS stock and bond markets are closed for the Thanksgiving holiday, Thursday\nUS stock and bond markets close early, Friday\nSome of the main moves in markets :\nStocks\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.4% as of 4:01 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 fell 1.1%The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%The MSCI World index rose 0.6%\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.4% as of 4:01 p.m. New York time\nThe Nasdaq 100 fell 1.1%\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%\nThe MSCI World index rose 0.6%\nCurrencies\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.7%The euro fell 0.8% to $1.0239The British pound fell 0.6% to $1.1818The Japanese yen fell 1.2% to 142.11 per dollar\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.7%\nThe euro fell 0.8% to $1.0239\nThe British pound fell 0.6% to $1.1818\nThe Japanese yen fell 1.2% to 142.11 per dollar\nCryptocurrencies\nBitcoin fell 2.8% to $15,800.01Ether fell 3.2% to $1,104.71\nBitcoin fell 2.8% to $15,800.01\nEther fell 3.2% to $1,104.71\nBonds\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 3.83%Germany’s 10-year yield declined two basis points to 1.99%Britain’s 10-year yield declined five basis points to 3.19%\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 3.83%\nGermany’s 10-year yield declined two basis points to 1.99%\nBritain’s 10-year yield declined five basis points to 3.19%\nCommodities\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.4% to $79.73 a barrelGold futures fell 0.8% to $1,755.20 an ounce\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.4% to $79.73 a barrel\nGold futures fell 0.8% to $1,755.20 an ounce\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n",

    "body": "<body>\n <p>\n  US stocks gained surer footing after a choppy morning session, extending a rally sparked by a slowdown in inflation. The dollar fell, declining for a fourth week.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The S&amp;P 500 closed near session highs in the biggest weekly gain since June. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 climbed more than 1.5%, notching its best week in two years. Cash Treasury trading is closed for Veterans Day.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Elsewhere, China easing some Covid restrictions helped underpin risk sentiment Friday, with US-listed Chinese stocks rising along with commodities from oil to soybeans to precious metals.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies resumed a selloff amid FTX’s deepening woes with Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire filing for bankruptcy. While that news weighed on sentiment in early trading, investors downplayed contagion risks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “From my vantage point, the real-world impact seems somewhat limited,” said Dan Suzuki, deputy chief investment officer at Richard Bernstein Advisors LLC. “It’s hard to imagine how it has a big impact on the overall economy. Crypto makes up a relatively small portion of financial markets, financial transaction, jobs, consumer spending, business spending, etc.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  US stocks soared the most since 2020 on Thursday after a better-than-forecast cooling in US inflation improved prospects of a dovish tilt by the Federal Reserve. On Friday, the University of Michigan’s preliminary November survey showed US consumer inflation expectations increased in the short and long run while sentiment retreated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Boston Fed President Susan Collins said that the risks of going too far have risen after a string of jumbo-sized rate hikes, but noted a smaller, more “deliberate” increase should not be confused with backing down from curbing price pressures.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “The moderation in the pace of inflation is a welcome development, while it is still far too early to declare the inflation threat over,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote. “We still think the Fed is likely to raise at least another 100 basis points in total before it pauses the rate hiking cycle.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  While markets reacted positively to the inflation print Thursday, Credit Suisse strategists led by Jonathan Golub said the rally was “out of sync with the size of the surprise.” This, they note, follows a pattern of outsize responses to CPI prints, which has averaged 2.8% on the day in the past seven releases.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The dollar slumped more than 1% on Friday in the biggest weekly drop since the pandemic-fueled volatility in March 2020.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bitcoin dropped as much as 8% to $16,376 and Ether fell as much as 9.2%. FTX.com’s bankruptcy filing capped a swift reversal of fortune for the crypto exchange led by Bankman-Fried.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Summers Says FTX Meltdown Has ‘Whiffs’ of Enron-Like Scandal\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pinduoduo Inc. and JD.com Inc. jumped in US trading amid growing optimism Beijing is on its way to ending the crippling Covid Zero policy.

The dollar fell, declining for a fourth week.\nThe S&P 500 closed near session highs in the biggest weekly gain since June. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 climbed more than 1.5%, notching its best week in two years. Cash Treasury trading is closed for Veterans Day.\nElsewhere, China easing some Covid restrictions helped underpin risk sentiment Friday, with US-listed Chinese stocks rising along with commodities from oil to soybeans to precious metals.\nMeanwhile, cryptocurrencies resumed a selloff amid FTX’s deepening woes with Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire filing for bankruptcy. While that news weighed on sentiment in early trading, investors downplayed contagion risks. \n“From my vantage point, the real-world impact seems somewhat limited,” said Dan Suzuki, deputy chief investment officer at Richard Bernstein Advisors LLC. “It’s hard to imagine how it has a big impact on the overall economy. Crypto makes up a relatively small portion of financial markets, financial transaction, jobs, consumer spending, business spending, etc.”\nUS stocks soared the most since 2020 on Thursday after a better-than-forecast cooling in US inflation improved prospects of a dovish tilt by the Federal Reserve. On Friday, the University of Michigan’s preliminary November survey showed US consumer inflation expectations increased in the short and long run while sentiment retreated. \nBoston Fed President Susan Collins said that the risks of going too far have risen after a string of jumbo-sized rate hikes, but noted a smaller, more “deliberate” increase should not be confused with backing down from curbing price pressures.\n“The moderation in the pace of inflation is a welcome development, while it is still far too early to declare the inflation threat over,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote. “We still think the Fed is likely to raise at least another 100 basis points in total before it pauses the rate hiking cycle.”\nWhile markets reacted positively to the inflation print Thursday, Credit Suisse strategists led by Jonathan Golub said the rally was “out of sync with the size of the surprise.” This, they note, follows a pattern of outsize responses to CPI prints, which has averaged 2.8% on the day in the past seven releases.\nThe dollar slumped more than 1% on Friday in the biggest weekly drop since the pandemic-fueled volatility in March 2020. \nBitcoin dropped as much as 8% to $16,376 and Ether fell as much as 9.2%. FTX.com’s bankruptcy filing capped a swift reversal of fortune for the crypto exchange led by Bankman-Fried.\nSummers Says FTX Meltdown Has ‘Whiffs’ of Enron-Like Scandal\nPinduoduo Inc. and JD.com Inc. jumped in US trading amid growing optimism Beijing is on its way to ending the crippling Covid Zero policy.

    "content": "US stocks declined as renewed selling in cryptocurrencies and disappointing earnings weighed on risk sentiment ahead of a key inflation report. The dollar gained for the first time in four days. \nThe S&P 500 put paid to a three-day rally, with all 11 major industry groups in the red. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 dropped the most among benchmarks, closing down 2.4%. Walt Disney Co. and News Corp. tumbled after posting results that fell short of expectations. Bitcoin dropped below $16,000 to a level not seen since 2020 amid a deepening selloff in cryptocurrencies as Binance walked away from its planned takeover of FTX.com. \nAfter midterm elections failed to deliver a Republican sweep, attention shifted toward the closely watched inflation report due Thursday for clues on the path of Federal Reserve policy tightening. \n“Elections matter, but other factors matter more for markets and the economy,” Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Wealth, said in a note. “The path of inflation, interest rates, monetary policy, the economy, and earnings will continue to exert the greatest influence on markets over the next year.”\nUS inflation probably moderated slightly in October, with the consumer price index and the core measure that excludes food and energy both seen cooling on an annual basis. But with the overall annual inflation rate exceeding forecasts in six of the prior seven months, another upside surprise could dash hopes of a Fed downshift after four jumbo rate hikes.\nOn the election front, investors had eyed prospects of a Republican comeback in Congress, with GOP taking control of both the House of Representatives and Senate. But US voters delivered a mixed verdict, with Republicans heading for control of the House by smaller margins than forecast and the race for Senate still wide open. \nRead more on elections\nGOP Closes In on Narrow House Majority, Senate Still in Play\nWarnock, Walker Head to Runoff That May Decide Control of Senate\nRon DeSantis Victory Sets Him on Collision Course With Trump\nCalifornia’s Slow Counting Could Delay House Control Decision\nRecord Number of Female Governors Win as Gender Gap Narrows\nMore commentary \n“Portfolios will assess and adjust their risk now that the ‘uncertainty’ of the U.S. mid-term elections fading,” wrote Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler. “Soon enough, their focus will shift back to this week’s corporate earnings results and the upcoming October CPI data.”“The market is still going to fixate on inflation, which is going to stay high and sticky at least over the next couple of quarters,” Luke Barrs, global head of fundamental equity client portfolio management at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said on Bloomberg TV.\n“Portfolios will assess and adjust their risk now that the ‘uncertainty’ of the U.S. mid-term elections fading,” wrote Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler. “Soon enough, their focus will shift back to this week’s corporate earnings results and the upcoming October CPI data.”\n“The market is still going to fixate on inflation, which is going to stay high and sticky at least over the next couple of quarters,” Luke Barrs, global head of fundamental equity client portfolio management at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said on Bloomberg TV.\nKey events this week:\nUS CPI, US initial jobless claims, ThursdayFed officials Lorie Logan, Esther George, Loretta Mester speak at events, ThursdayUS University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Friday\nUS CPI, US initial jobless claims, Thursday\nFed officials Lorie Logan, Esther George, Loretta Mester speak at events, Thursday\nUS University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Friday\nMLIV Pulse SurveyWhat’s the biggest risk for China assets in 2023?

    "body": "<body>\n <p>\n  US shares rose in a broad-based rally that swept up small caps as well as blue-chip stocks, ahead of midterm elections and inflation data later this week. The dollar fell with Treasuries.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The S&amp;P 500 closed near session highs, with all but three of the 11 industry groups advancing. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 also caught bids, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed, rising as much as 1.5% with health-care names topping the leaderboard.

    "body": "<body>\n <p>\n  Wall Street contended with another volatile session as investors mulled the Federal Reserve’s path of interest-rate hikes while assessing mixed economic data and a slew of earnings reports.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Amazon.com Inc. plunged after hours as its sales forecast trailed estimates. Shares of Apple Inc. struggled for direction postmarket after it reported weaker-than-expected iPhone and services sales in its latest quarter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The S&amp;P 500 closed lower, after swinging between gains and losses for most of the session. The Nasdaq 100 fell more than 1% in regular trading and an exchange-traded fund tracking it slid further after 4 p.m. in New York. Lackluster earnings from several megacap firms this week dampened sentiment and underscored the impact of the Fed’s tightening regime. Meta Platforms Inc. posted its worst one-day drop since February on Thursday, triggered by burgeoning metaverse costs and a decline in revenue.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Markets were also mixed on US gross domestic product data. The report showed the US economy rebounded after two quarterly contractions, which briefly assuaged concerns of an imminent recession. But it also highlighted that consumer spending remains under pressure because of inflation. Treasuries gained, with the 10-year yield pushing below 4% on speculation of a Fed pivot. The dollar snapped a two-day drop.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The stock and currency markets digested the GDP data differently because it’s difficult to tell what the Fed is planning to do next, said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “The US dollar is reading into this that perhaps it’s going to keep the Fed on that hawkish path for longer,” Cincotta said by phone. “Whereas the stock market seems to be reading it completely differently, almost as if it’s expecting the Fed to be sort of moving toward that less hawkish stuff.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  Economists still expect the Fed to hike by three-quarters of a percentage point for the fourth time in a row when it meets next week. But with recent data highlighting the effects of the Fed’s sharp rate hikes on the economy, investors expect the central bank to slow its pace of tightening after November’s meeting.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “It’s not about a pivot and cutting interest rates,” Alec Young, chief investment strategist at MAPsignals, said in an interview. “It’s just about the Fed becoming more data-dependent and acknowledging there’s already a lot of tightening in the pipeline from all the rate hikes they’ve put through so far.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  Earlier, the European Central Bank lifted its policy rate by 75 basis points -- in line with expectations -- and signaled more tightening ahead.

    "content": "Wall Street contended with another volatile session as investors mulled the Federal Reserve’s path of interest-rate hikes while assessing mixed economic data and a slew of earnings reports. \nAmazon.com Inc. plunged after hours as its sales forecast trailed estimates. Shares of Apple Inc. struggled for direction postmarket after it reported weaker-than-expected iPhone and services sales in its latest quarter. \nThe S&P 500 closed lower, after swinging between gains and losses for most of the session. The Nasdaq 100 fell more than 1% in regular trading and an exchange-traded fund tracking it slid further after 4 p.m. in New York. Lackluster earnings from several megacap firms this week dampened sentiment and underscored the impact of the Fed’s tightening regime. Meta Platforms Inc. posted its worst one-day drop since February on Thursday, triggered by burgeoning metaverse costs and a decline in revenue.\nMarkets were also mixed on US gross domestic product data. The report showed the US economy rebounded after two quarterly contractions, which briefly assuaged concerns of an imminent recession. But it also highlighted that consumer spending remains under pressure because of inflation. Treasuries gained, with the 10-year yield pushing below 4% on speculation of a Fed pivot. The dollar snapped a two-day drop.  \nThe stock and currency markets digested the GDP data differently because it’s difficult to tell what the Fed is planning to do next, said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index.\n“The US dollar is reading into this that perhaps it’s going to keep the Fed on that hawkish path for longer,” Cincotta said by phone. “Whereas the stock market seems to be reading it completely differently, almost as if it’s expecting the Fed to be sort of moving toward that less hawkish stuff.”\nEconomists still expect the Fed to hike by three-quarters of a percentage point for the fourth time in a row when it meets next week. But with recent data highlighting the effects of the Fed’s sharp rate hikes on the economy, investors expect the central bank to slow its pace of tightening after November’s meeting.  \n“It’s not about a pivot and cutting interest rates,” Alec Young, chief investment strategist at MAPsignals, said in an interview. “It’s just about the Fed becoming more data-dependent and acknowledging there’s already a lot of tightening in the pipeline from all the rate hikes they’ve put through so far.”\nEarlier, the European Central Bank lifted its policy rate by 75 basis points -- in line with expectations -- and signaled more tightening ahead. But ECB officials weren’t unanimous about the size of the interest-rate hike and sought to avoid giving a specific signal on their next move in December, according to people familiar with the matter.\nShare your views on key ESG themesESG is one of the largest, and most debated, investment approaches in markets today.

Traders also mulled whether the Federal Reserve will slow its pace of interest-rate hikes after assessing weak economic data that released Monday.\n </p>\n <p>\n  More than 80% of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index closed in green on Monday, buoyed by gains in technology and health-care companies. The Nasdaq 100 also rose more than 1%. US-listed Chinese shares plunged after that nation’s equity index tumbled as President Xi Jinping solidified his power. Among the megacap companies slated to report earnings this week are Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  US Treasury 10-year yields ended the session around 4.25%. UK bonds posted some of their biggest gains on record as investors expect incoming Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to repair the damage caused by predecessor Liz Truss after her massive package of unfunded tax cuts roiled financial markets.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Earnings remain in focus in the US, with investors still on edge over whether companies that are among the key profit-growth engines for the S&amp;P 500 can deliver profits with inflation crimping margins. Of the almost 20% of companies that have reported so far, roughly 58% posted positive surprises in both revenue and earnings per share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. As the Fed attempts to stomp out inflation, latest earnings displaying resilience and showing few signs of recession may be making some investors uneasy on equities.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “Over the short-term, we think we can get some relief. The fact that earnings season has also been relatively strong is also helpful,” Andrew Sheets, Morgan Stanley’s chief cross-asset strategist, said on Bloomberg Television. “But the big picture -- and I don’t think this changes -- is that we still view this as a bear market rally rather than the start of a larger new bull market.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fed policy is also still a key focus for investors. Data on Monday indicated that Fed tightening is starting to hit the economy, with Purchasing Managers’ Index indicators showing contraction in the services and manufacturing sectors. Reports that the Fed may soon start reducing the size of its rate hikes had pushed stocks higher by more than 2% on Friday. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly’s comments on Friday also added to the tentative optimism. But some investors are still cautious in their expectations that the central bank is moderating its rhetoric.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “We are still agnostic as to whether the Fed really is going to pivot or be at the peak of its hawkish cycle,” said Lisa Erickson, senior vice president and head of public markets group at US Bank Wealth Management. “If you look at the underlying data, inflation remains sticky, particularly in services ex-housing, which can often be more persistent. So given the Fed’s dependence on the data, we’re not clear exactly again, when the Fed may truly begin to slow down.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  The central bank needs to maintain a balance between addressing inflation and reacting appropriately to any signs of slowdown in inflation, Erickson said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Key events this week:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Earnings due this week include: Apple, Microsoft, Exxon Mobil, Ford Motor, Credit Suisse, Airbus, Alphabet, Amazon, Bank of China, Boeing, Caterpillar, Cnooc, Coca-Cola, HSBC, Intel, McDonald’s, Mercedes-Benz, Merck, Samsung Electronics, Shell, UBS, UPS, Vale, Visa, Volkswagen\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   US Conference Board consumer confidence, Tuesday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Bank of Canada rate decision, Wednesday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   ECB rate decision, Thursday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   US GDP, durable goods orders, initial jobless claims, Thursday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Bank of Japan policy decision, Friday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   US personal income, personal spending, pending home sales, University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Friday\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Some of the main moves in markets:\n </p>\n <h3>\n  Stocks\n </h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2% as of 4 p.m. New York time\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The Nasdaq 100 rose 1.1%\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3%\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The MSCI World index rose 1.2%\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <h3>\n  Currencies\n </h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.4%\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The euro rose 0.1% to $0.9873\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The British pound fell 0.2% to $1.1279\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The Japanese yen fell 0.9% to 148.98 per dollar\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <h3>\n  Cryptocurrencies\n </h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Bitcoin fell 0.8% to $19,341.76\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Ether rose 1.1% to $1,344.95\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <h3>\n  Bonds\n </h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced three basis points to 4.25%\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Germany’s 10-year yield declined nine basis points to 2.33%\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Britain’s 10-year yield declined 31 basis points to 3.75%\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <h3>\n  Commodities\n </h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   West Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.5% to $84.66 a barrel\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,654.20 an ounce\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <ol>\n </ol>\n</body>",

As the Fed attempts to stomp out inflation, latest earnings displaying resilience and showing few signs of recession may be making some investors uneasy on equities. \n“Over the short-term, we think we can get some relief. The fact that earnings season has also been relatively strong is also helpful,” Andrew Sheets, Morgan Stanley’s chief cross-asset strategist, said on Bloomberg Television. “But the big picture -- and I don’t think this changes -- is that we still view this as a bear market rally rather than the start of a larger new bull market.”\nFed policy is also still a key focus for investors. Data on Monday indicated that Fed tightening is starting to hit the economy, with Purchasing Managers’ Index indicators showing contraction in the services and manufacturing sectors. Reports that the Fed may soon start reducing the size of its rate hikes had pushed stocks higher by more than 2% on Friday. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly’s comments on Friday also added to the tentative optimism. But some investors are still cautious in their expectations that the central bank is moderating its rhetoric. \n“We are still agnostic as to whether the Fed really is going to pivot or be at the peak of its hawkish cycle,” said Lisa Erickson, senior vice president and head of public markets group at US Bank Wealth Management. “If you look at the underlying data, inflation remains sticky, particularly in services ex-housing, which can often be more persistent. So given the Fed’s dependence on the data, we’re not clear exactly again, when the Fed may truly begin to slow down.”\nThe central bank needs to maintain a balance between addressing inflation and reacting appropriately to any signs of slowdown in inflation, Erickson said. \nKey events this week:\nEarnings due this week include: Apple, Microsoft, Exxon Mobil, Ford Motor, Credit Suisse, Airbus, Alphabet, Amazon, Bank of China, Boeing, Caterpillar, Cnooc, Coca-Cola, HSBC, Intel, McDonald’s, Mercedes-Benz, Merck, Samsung Electronics, Shell, UBS, UPS, Vale, Visa, VolkswagenUS Conference Board consumer confidence, TuesdayBank of Canada rate decision, WednesdayECB rate decision, ThursdayUS GDP, durable goods orders, initial jobless claims, ThursdayBank of Japan policy decision, FridayUS personal income, personal spending, pending home sales, University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Friday\nEarnings due this week include: Apple, Microsoft, Exxon Mobil, Ford Motor, Credit Suisse, Airbus, Alphabet, Amazon, Bank of China, Boeing, Caterpillar, Cnooc, Coca-Cola, HSBC, Intel, McDonald’s, Mercedes-Benz, Merck, Samsung Electronics, Shell, UBS, UPS, Vale, Visa, Volkswagen\nUS Conference Board consumer confidence, Tuesday\nBank of Canada rate decision, Wednesday\nECB rate decision, Thursday\nUS GDP, durable goods orders, initial jobless claims, Thursday\nBank of Japan policy decision, Friday\nUS personal income, personal spending, pending home sales, University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Friday\nSome of the main moves in markets:\nStocks\nThe S&P 500 rose 1.2% as of 4 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 rose 1.1%The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3%The MSCI World index rose 1.2%\nThe S&P 500 rose 1.2% as of 4 p.m. New York time\nThe Nasdaq 100 rose 1.1%\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3%\nThe MSCI World index rose 1.2%\nCurrencies\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.4%The euro rose 0.1% to $0.9873The British pound fell 0.2% to $1.1279The Japanese yen fell 0.9% to 148.98 per dollar\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.4%\nThe euro rose 0.1% to $0.9873\nThe British pound fell 0.2% to $1.1279\nThe Japanese yen fell 0.9% to 148.98 per dollar\nCryptocurrencies\nBitcoin fell 0.8% to $19,341.76Ether rose 1.1% to $1,344.95\nBitcoin fell 0.8% to $19,341.76\nEther rose 1.1% to $1,344.95\nBonds\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced three basis points to 4.25%Germany’s 10-year yield declined nine basis points to 2.33%Britain’s 10-year yield declined 31 basis points to 3.75%\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced three basis points to 4.25%\nGermany’s 10-year yield declined nine basis points to 2.33%\nBritain’s 10-year yield declined 31 basis points to 3.75%\nCommodities\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.5% to $84.66 a barrelGold futures fell 0.1% to $1,654.20 an ounce\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.5% to $84.66 a barrel\nGold futures fell 0.1% to $1,654.20 an ounce\n",

    "body": "<body>\n <p>\n  US stocks roared back from losses sparked by a hot inflation reading on speculation the yearlong selloff had potentially reached a bottom.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The S&amp;P 500 closed up 2.6% after swinging more than 5% during a wild trading day. The benchmark clawed back more than 40% of the losses over a six-day selloff that took it to a two-year low.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Technical levels factored into the bounce. At one point, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 had given back 50% of its post-pandemic rally, triggering programmed buying. A wave of put options bought to protect against such a rout moved into the money, and as profits were booked, that prompted dealers to buy stocks to remain market neutral.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A gauge of consumer price growth rose to a 40-year high last month, sealing the case for the Fed to deliver a large rate hike in November. Stocks plunged 25% this year before Thursday’s rebound, as the central bank tightened policy to curb inflation, leaving investors to weigh how much damage is left for share prices.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “There may be some short covering going on, but also, a lot was priced in,” said Michael Contopoulos, director of fixed income at Richard Bernstein Advisors. “There has likely been a fair amount of defensive positioning lately in equities and on the rates side, higher policy rates means higher probability of a hard landing.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  Read more: Big Hedges, 50% Charts, Okay Earnings: Behind the Stock Bounce\n </p>\n <p>\n  Read more: Hot Inflation Torches Bears in a Stock Reversal for the Ages\n </p>\n <p>\n  Risk assets have been under pressure all year as central banks around the world attempt to tame runaway inflation. The latest data added to evidence the harsh monetary medicine has yet to take hold and comes on the heels of last week’s payrolls figures that showed unemployment rate at a five-decade low in September.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Treasury curve flattened, with the yield on policy-sensitive two-year notes up 18 basis points at 4.47%. Market bets on rates now lean toward back-to-back 75 basis-point hikes at the next two Fed meetings and expect the central bank to push rates past 4.85% before the tightening cycle ends. The current rate is 3.25%.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the earnings front, Delta Air Lines Inc., Domino’s Pizza Inc. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. gained on better-than-expected results. Big banks including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Citigroup Inc. are due to report on Friday.\n </p>\n <p>\n  More market commentary\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   “If you had some levered CTA who had a big buy program set to start around 3,505 and then another levered short who doubled down on the CPI print that could have created this snowball where market just ripped as other levered technical systematic traders piled in,” Max Gokhman, chief investment officer for AlphaTrAI, said. “Or someone just got a fat margin call. We may find out after the dust settles.”\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   “There’s so much uncertainty in the market and so many data points are conflicting that the market responds to whatever is the most recent data point,” said Ellen Hazen, chief market strategist and portfolio manager at F.L.Putnam Investment Management. “So this morning with the reversal in the UK the market was up pre-open, then we got CPI and then it was down. And then we look at the fact that we bounced off of this support level and that becomes self-fulfilling.”\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   “This isn’t the CPI report markets or the Fed were hoping for,” said James Athey, investment director at abrdn. “Inflation pressures remain stubbornly high. The reality is that for the foreseeable future the Fed is locked into a stance of unequivocal hawkishness.

    "content": "US stocks roared back from losses sparked by a hot inflation reading on speculation the yearlong selloff had potentially reached a bottom. \nThe S&P 500 closed up 2.6% after swinging more than 5% during a wild trading day. The benchmark clawed back more than 40% of the losses over a six-day selloff that took it to a two-year low. \nTechnical levels factored into the bounce. At one point, the benchmark S&P 500 had given back 50% of its post-pandemic rally, triggering programmed buying. A wave of put options bought to protect against such a rout moved into the money, and as profits were booked, that prompted dealers to buy stocks to remain market neutral. \nA gauge of consumer price growth rose to a 40-year high last month, sealing the case for the Fed to deliver a large rate hike in November. Stocks plunged 25% this year before Thursday’s rebound, as the central bank tightened policy to curb inflation, leaving investors to weigh how much damage is left for share prices.\n“There may be some short covering going on, but also, a lot was priced in,” said Michael Contopoulos, director of fixed income at Richard Bernstein Advisors. “There has likely been a fair amount of defensive positioning lately in equities and on the rates side, higher policy rates means higher probability of a hard landing.”\nRead more: Big Hedges, 50% Charts, Okay Earnings: Behind the Stock Bounce\nRead more: Hot Inflation Torches Bears in a Stock Reversal for the Ages\nRisk assets have been under pressure all year as central banks around the world attempt to tame runaway inflation. The latest data added to evidence the harsh monetary medicine has yet to take hold and comes on the heels of last week’s payrolls figures that showed unemployment rate at a five-decade low in September.\nThe Treasury curve flattened, with the yield on policy-sensitive two-year notes up 18 basis points at 4.47%. Market bets on rates now lean toward back-to-back 75 basis-point hikes at the next two Fed meetings and expect the central bank to push rates past 4.85% before the tightening cycle ends. The current rate is 3.25%.\nOn the earnings front, Delta Air Lines Inc., Domino’s Pizza Inc. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. gained on better-than-expected results. Big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are due to report on Friday.\nMore market commentary\n“If you had some levered CTA who had a big buy program set to start around 3,505 and then another levered short who doubled down on the CPI print that could have created this snowball where market just ripped as other levered technical systematic traders piled in,” Max Gokhman, chief investment officer for AlphaTrAI, said. “Or someone just got a fat margin call. We may find out after the dust settles.”“There’s so much uncertainty in the market and so many data points are conflicting that the market responds to whatever is the most recent data point,” said Ellen Hazen, chief market strategist and portfolio manager at F.L.Putnam Investment Management. “So this morning with the reversal in the UK the market was up pre-open, then we got CPI and then it was down. And then we look at the fact that we bounced off of this support level and that becomes self-fulfilling.”“This isn’t the CPI report markets or the Fed were hoping for,” said James Athey, investment director at abrdn. “Inflation pressures remain stubbornly high. The reality is that for the foreseeable future the Fed is locked into a stance of unequivocal hawkishness. This will support bond yields and the US dollar but its yet more bad news for equities.”“After today’s inflation report, there can’t be anyone left in the market who believes the Fed can raise rates by anything less than 75bps at the November meeting,” Seema Shah, strategist at Principal Global Investors wrote. “In fact, if this kind of upside surprise is repeated next month, we could be facing a fifth consecutive 0.75% hike in December with policy rates blowing through the Fed’s peak rate forecast before this year is over.”Given the latest CPI report, “any continued pick-up in energy prices can get us to a new high” in headline inflation, said Steve Chiavarone, senior portfolio manager at Federated Hermes. That “could very well spook markets as it pushes back any expectation of peak inflation, peak Fed hawkishness and could force the market to contemplate a terminal fed funds rate above 5%. All that would raise the risks of more bond pain, more equity pain, and a greater risk of financial accident.”\n“If you had some levered CTA who had a big buy program set to start around 3,505 and then another levered short who doubled down on the CPI print that could have created this snowball where market just ripped as other levered technical systematic traders piled in,” Max Gokhman, chief investment officer for AlphaTrAI, said. “Or someone just got a fat margin call.
