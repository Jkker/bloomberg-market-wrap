US stocks rose in a volatile session as investors parsed the latest corporate news and the potential for geopolitical risks in Europe. The dollar gained, while the euro fell as Italy’s government looked set to collapse.

The S&P 500 posted its first back-to-back gain in almost two weeks, with advances in tech and consumer discretionary stocks offsetting declines in defensive sectors, utilities and health care. While tech stocks briefly pared their advance after Google said it will pause hiring for two weeks, gains in Netflix Inc. on better-than-feared earnings underpinned rallies in streaming peers as well as confidence in consumers’ resilience.

After the bell, Tesla Inc. reported earnings that beat Wall Street estimates, reflecting progress in getting production back on track. The shares initially jumped on the news before trading little changed. Alcoa Corp. climbed after earnings topped estimates and the aluminum producer announced an additional $500 million share buyback.

Stocks advanced for third day in four amid optimism over the earnings season and growing speculation markets may have bottomed out. While that debate continues, with Sanford C. Bernstein strategists saying markets have yet to see full capitulation, rates markets have discarded bets the Federal Reserve will hike rates by a full percentage point next week, bolstering optimism the central bank will take a more measured approach to policy tightening.

“The fact that companies are showing a certain resilience to the current environment is reassuring market operators who have now started betting on a less aggressive monetary tightening than initially expected,” said Pierre Veyret, a technical analyst at ActivTrades. “Even if we’re not out of the woods yet, more and more traders now tend to believe the worst is behind for equity markets this year.”

The euro tumbled as Italy’s Prime Minister Mario Draghi appeared set to fall in a confidence vote after three key parties announced they wouldn’t support him.

Risk sentiment also took a hit earlier on news the European Union is preparing for a scenario where Russia halts gas exports to retaliate against sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin signaled Europe will start getting gas, but warned that unless a spat over sanctioned parts is resolved, flows will be tightly curbed.

Oil edged lower as growing stockpiles of crude and gasoline tempered fears of a tight market. Bitcoin gained for a third straight day, rising above $24,000 for the first time in more than a month.

More market commentary

*   “While I hope markets have bottomed, and I hope extreme pessimism can result in capitulation, it’s my job to point out the underlying factors behind market moves, and the bottom line is neither the economy nor corporate earnings have felt the full brunt of Fed tightening,” Tom Essaye, a former Merrill Lynch trader who founded The Sevens Report newsletter, said in a note.
*   “Netflix earnings can be interpreted that the US consumer can be doing a little bit better than anticipated,” said Ellen Hazen, chief market strategist and portfolio manager at F.L.Putnam Investment Management.
*   “Without Fed support from the corner, selling pressure has been severe and finally reached the washed-out level readings we have been watching for since the S&P 500 first broke down from its head and shoulders top formation,” Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler, said in a note.
